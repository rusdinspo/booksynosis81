Over the next twelve months, tens of thousands of aircrews flew across the North Sea to drop bombs on German cities. They were opposed not only by the full force of the Luftwaffe, but by a nightmare of flak, treacherously icy conditions, and constant mechanical malfunction. Most of these courageous crews were either shot down and killed or taken prisoner by an increasingly hostile enemy. <p>This is the story of the everyday heroism of these crews in the days when it was widely believed that the Allies could win the Second World War by air alone. American pilots had a special role in the &#x201c;Dambusters&#x201d; campaign in particular. Even before the attacks on Pearl Harbor, scores of eager pilots travelled across the Canadian border to train with other future &#x201c;Dambusters,&#x201d; all eager to take part.</p><p>Authoritative and gripping, <em>Airborne in 1943</em> brings these remarkable men and women to vivid life.</p> 16 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Kevin Wilson has spent most of his working life as a staff journalist on British national newspapers, including the Daily Mail and the Sunday Express.

Growing up in a minor noble family in remote Perm, he would become a central figure in the artistic worlds of Paris, London, Berlin, and Madrid during the golden age of modern art. He lived through bankruptcy, war, revolution, and exile. Furthermore he lived openly as a homosexual and his liaisons, most famously with Nijinsky, and his turbulent friendships with Stravinsky, Coco Chanel, Prokofiev, and Jean Cocteau gave his life an exceptionally dramatic quality. Scheijen's magnificent biography, based on extensive research in little known archives, especially in Russia, brings fully to life a complex and powerful personality with boundless creative energy. <br>A <em>New York Times</em> Editor's Choice<br></p><p><br><strong>Sjeng Scheijen</strong> is a Senior Research Fellow and Veni-laureate at Leiden University in The Netherlands. He is a historian of Russian art, an exhibition curator, and a former cultural attach� at the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Moscow.<br><br>"Sjeng Scheijen's biography of Ballets Russes impresario Serge Diaghilev (1872-1929) has been universally welcomed as the best to date...[This] biography of Diaghilev is indispensable and a well-written 'page turner' besides...Scheijen's command of the subject resounds on every page. Ninety years after his death we have the first scholarly biography of Serge Diaghilev in English and it is a winner." --<em>Slavic Review</em><p></p><br>"The parade of great dancers, composers, and artists through Diahilev's life give this book the sweep of a Russian novel with a fascinating, brilliant, and complex protagonist who, according to the author, lived a very public life, but kept his most intimate feelings hidden." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"A vivid portrait of this morbid, nomadic, charming-yet-secretive visionary." --<em>Classic FM Magazine</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Drawing on a great deal of new research, and relying wherever possible on contemporary journals and letters, Scheijen puts Diaghilev into a different frame to any of his previous biographers.... Scheijen masterfully recounts the phenomenal way in which Diaghilev contrived, under virtually impossible circumstances, to nurture a sequence of works, from Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Debussy, Ravel, Falla, Milhaud, designed by Bakst, Picasso, Derain, Matisse, Mir�, danced by Nijinsky, Karsavina, Massine, Lifar, choreographed by Fokine, Nijinsky, Nijinska, Massine, each more audacious than the last, many of them still in the repertoire."--Simon Callow, <em>The Guardian</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"An expansive, immensely readable text... A must for anyone intrigued by the Ballets Russes and the ingenious impresario indelibly linked with its achievements." --<em>Times Higher Education</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Sergei Diaghilev was a transformative force in the history of 20th century culture thanks to his promotion of Russian art, Russian opera and, of course, the Ballets Russes. After exhaustive research in Russian, European and American archives, Sjeng Scheijen presents us with a multi-facetted and synthetic portrait of Diaghilev, adducing much new biographical and critical material. With important sections on Diaghilev's family, education, esthetic criteria and psychological makeup, Sergei Diaghilev: A Life is a luminous, engaging and refreshing study of Diaghilev's national commitment, international mission and deep influence on the evolution of the visual and performing arts."--Professor. John Bowlt, University of Southern California <br> <br><p></p><br>'Sjeng Scheijen's new book about Diaghilev is absolutely wonderful. It is filled with the most fascinating information and is a completely intriguing read.... [An] exceptional book'--Dame Monica Mason, DBE, Director of the Royal Ballet <br> <br><p></p><br>"No biography is definitive - yet I cannot imagine any book that will supersede this account of how Diaghilev ballets came into being. It is an astonishing achievement."--Michael Holroyd <br> <br><p></p><br>"Previous biographies... have said little or nothing of the family Diaghilev left behind in Russia. Mr. Scheijen, a Dutch expert in Russian art, demonstrates, however, that Diaghilev made repeated efforts to contact them... Mr. Scheijen draws happily from a wide range of sources that have become available in recent years in Russia and the West... an important addition to the large shelf of Diaghilev literature." --Alistair Macauley, <em>The New York Times</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"...new document enable Scheijen to sweep out many cob-webbed corners in the Diaghilev story... The leading edge of Scheijen's revisionism, however, is not his fact-correcting but his reinterpretations... An admirable book. Apart from its revisionism, its most striking quality is its avoidance of clutter, and hence its rhetorical force... Above all, [Scheijen[ has tried to provide a deep and unified account of Diaghilev's personality. It's not a soul laid bare - Diaghilev was secretive - but something closer than we've seen before." <br>Joan Acocella, <em>The New Yorker</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Diaghilev's Ballets Russes attracted devotees who behaved as if under the spell of an almost cult-like intoxication. The rapture of art at its most transformative seemed to infect everyone connected to the impresario. The major achievement of Diaghilev: A Life is probably its detailed portrait of Diaghilev's private life, but at the same time Mr. Scheijen helps us to feel something of that rapture." -Joel Lobenthal, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"[A] meaty and rigorously researched new biography...<em>Diaghilev: A Life</em> is especially excellent on its subject's formative years... Scheijen dexterously plays his sources against one another to examine the erotic and professional dynamics between Diaghilev and his stars." -Jennifer B. McDonald, <em>The</em> <em>New York Times Book Review</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Diaghilev was larger than life, and this biography is an absorbing and dramatic account of an extraordinary individual and his time." -<em>Library Journal</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"In Scheijen's hands, this is quite a read, quite a life, and quite a book." -<em>Playbill.com</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Scheijen provides a comprehensive, well-balanced chronicle of the professional and personal life of the famous, and infamous, Russian impressario Serge Diaghilev... A substantial addition to the literature on Diaghilev and his Ballet Russes, the book benefits from Scheijen's access to and selective use of materials from previously inaccessible Russian archives." -<em>Choice</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"An admirable biographical study, and a fascinating overview of the Russian art world and its European connections in the early twentieth century." --<em>Times Literary Supplement</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"The epic life of the impresario of the Ballets Russes is captured in Sjeng Scheijen's <em>Diaghilev</em>, which... proves that 'design by committee' is not necessarily doomed." --<em>Harper's Magazine</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Warriors: Omen of the Stars #3: Night Whispers</h2><p><p>After the sharp-eyed Jay and the roaring Lion, peace will come on Dove&#x2019;s gentle wing.</p><p>Jayfeather and Lionblaze are determined to uncover the real reason that ThunderClan was led into the deadly battle with ShadowClan.

In the first of the four cases LA PI Philip Marlowe is offered a job that leaves a bad taste in the mouth: smearing a girl who&#x2019;s &#x2018;got her hooks into a rich man&#x2019;s pup&#x2019;. Before too long Marlowe&#x2019;s up to his neck in corpses and cops and he&#x2019;s taken pity on the girl. There&#x2019;s nothing like making trouble of your business . . . The four novellas collected here are quintessential Raymond Chandler: slick, crystal-clear writing that pins the reader to the seat and won&#x2019;t let go until the last page is turned.</p><p>In the four long stories in this collection, Marlowe is hired to protect a rich old guy from a gold digger, runs afoul of crooked politicos, gets a line on some stolen jewels with a reward attached, and stumbles across a murder victim who may have been an extortionist.Raymond Thornton Chandler (1888 - 1959) was the master practitioner of American hard-boiled crime fiction. Although he was born in Chicago, Chandler spent most of his boyhood and youth in England where he attended Dulwich College and later worked as a freelance journalist for &#34;The Westminster Gazette&#34; and &#34;The Spectator,&#34; During World War I, Chandler served in France with the First Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, transferring later to the Royal Flying Corps (R. A. F.). In 1919 he returned to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually became director of a number of independent oil companies. The Depression put an end to his career, and in 1933, at the age of forty-five, he turned to writing fiction, publishing his first stories in &#34;Black Mask,&#34; Chandler&#39;s detective stories often starred the brash but honorable Philip Marlowe (introduced in 1939 in his first novel, The Big Sleep) and were noted for their literate presentation and dead-on critical eye. Never a prolific writer, Chandler published only one collection of stories and seven novels in his lifetime. Some of Chandler&#39;s novels, like The Big Sleep, were made into classic movies which helped define the film noir style. In the last year of his life he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. He died in La Jolla, California on March 26, 1959.</p><h2>Nomad (Tribe of One -Book 3)</h2><p>After Sorak finds the Sage, who explains to him how he came to be splintered into countless separate beings, Sorak gathers all the members of his tribe of one and launches a war against the evils of Athas.

The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart.</p><p>At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards.</p><p>In the first half of <i>Clear and Simple,</i> the authors introduce a range of styles--reflexive, practical, plain, contemplative, romantic, prophetic, and others--contrasting them to classic style. Its principles are simple: The writer adopts the pose that the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader is an intellectual equal, and the occasion is informal. Classic style is at home in everything from business memos to personal letters, from magazine articles to university writing.</p><p>The second half of the book is a tour of examples--the exquisite and the execrable--showing what has worked and what hasn't. Classic prose is found everywhere: from Thomas Jefferson to Junichir&#x14d; Tanizaki, from Mark Twain to the observations of an undergraduate. Here are many fine performances in classic style, each clear and simple as the truth.</p><p>Originally published in 1994.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p>These days, discussions of writing style are generally limited to superficialities such as serial commas and approved abbreviations. It's a pity. While consistency in writing does make for more pleasant reading, no amount of rule-abiding can mask poorly wrought prose. In <i>Clear and Simple As the Truth</i>, Francis-No�l Thomas and Mark Turner argue that "writing is an intellectual activity, not a bundle of skills." The first half of their book is a probing examination of classic style, the form popularized by 17th-century French prose writers such as Descartes, Pascal, and Madame de S�vign� and best typified contemporarily by much of the writing in the pre-1985 <i>New Yorker</i>. The authors liken classic style to those theorems in mathematics valued for being "brief, efficient, clear, elegant, and pure." The classic sentence appears effortless, "as if it could have been written in no other way," and while "the writer may speak with a technical mastery not possessed by the reader ... his attitude is always that the reader lacks this mastery only accidentally." While one can hardly hope to distill the essence of classic style into a sentence, Thomas and Turner describe it most succinctly as expression that is "clear and simple as the truth, but no clearer or simpler." <p> The second half of the book is a "museum" of classic prose, by Thomas Jefferson, Descartes, Jane Austen, Mark Twain, Richard Feynman, Oscar Wilde, Philip Larkin, and many others, accompanied by commentary from the authors.</p>A free on-line instructor's guide for using <i>Clear and Simple as the Truth</i> in the classroom is available at http://www.wam.umd.edu/~mturn/WWW/csguide.html.</p><h2>Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters</h2><p>The personal correspondences of Mary Todd Lincoln create an intimate portrait of her life and marriage to Lincoln as well as her struggles after his death</p><p>The Turners draw on about half of the 610 extant letters written by Mary Todd Lincoln and present a comprehensive portrait of Lincoln's bitterly unhappy wife.

All his trouble come to him from the outside.<br><br>E. J. Watson turned up at Half Way Creek back in 1892, worked on the produce farms awhile, worked in the cane. Hard worker, too, but it don&#x2019;t seem like he hoed cane for the money, it was more like he wanted a feel for our community. Strong, good-looking feller in his thirties, dark red hair, well made, thick through the shoulders but no fat on him, not in them days. Close to six foot and carried himself well, folks noticed him straight off and no one fooled with him. First time you seen the man you wanted him to like you&#x2014;he was that kind. Wore a broad black hat and a black frock coat with big pockets, made him look bulky. Times we was cutting buttonwood with ax and hand saw, two-three cords a day&#x2014;that&#x2019;s hot, hard, humid work, case you ain&#x2019;t done it&#x2014;Ed Watson never changed that outfit. Kept that coat on over his denim coveralls, he said, cause he never knew when he might expect some company from up north. Might smile a little when he said that but never give no explanation.<br><br>Folks didn&#x2019;t know where this stranger come from and nobody asked. You didn&#x2019;t ask a man hard questions, not in the Ten Thousand Islands, not in them days. Folks will tell you different today, but back then there weren&#x2019;t too many in our section that wasn&#x2019;t on the run from someplace else. Who would come to these rain-rotted islands with not hardly enough high ground to build a outhouse, and so many miskeeters plaguing you in the bad summers you thought you&#x2019;d took the wrong turn straight to Hell?<br><br>Old Man William Brown was cutting cane, and he listened to them men opining how this Watson feller was so able and so friendly. Old Man William took him a slow drink of water, give a sigh. Willie Brown said, &#x201c;Well, now, Papa, is that sigh a warnin?&#x201d; And his daddy said, &#x201c;I feel somethin, is all. Same way I feel the damp.&#x201d; They all respected Old Man William, but there weren&#x2019;t one man in the cane that day that took him serious.<br><br>All the same, we noticed quick, you drawed too close to E. J. Watson, he eased out sideways like a crab, gave himself room. One time, my half-uncle Tant Jenkins come up on him letting his water, and Mister Watson come around so fast Tant Jenkins thought this feller aimed to piss on him. By the time Tant seen it weren&#x2019;t his pecker he had in his hand, that gun was halfway back into them coveralls, but not so fast he could not be sure of what he seen.<br><br>Being brash as well as nervous, Tant says, &#x201c;Well, now, Mister Watson! Still es-pectin company from the North?&#x201d; And Watson says, very agreeable, &#x201c;Any company that shows up unexpected will find me ready with a nice warm welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>Ed Watson had money in his pocket when he come to Half Way Creek, which ain&#x2019;t none of my business, but in all the years I knew him, right up till near the end, he always come up with money when he had to. We never knew till later he was on the dodge, but Half Way Creek was too handy to the lawmen for his liking. Ain&#x2019;t nothing much out there today but a few old cisterns, but Half Way Creek had near a dozen families then, more than Everglade or Chokoloskee. Course back in them days there weren&#x2019;t hardly a hundred souls in that whole hundred mile of coast south to Cape Sable.<br><br>Mister Watson weren&#x2019;t at Half Way Creek but a few days when he paid cash money for William Brown&#x2019;s old schooner. Ain&#x2019;t many would buy a sixty-foot schooner that didn&#x2019;t know nothing about boats. Time he was done, Ed Watson was one of the best boatmen on this coast.<br><br>Mister Watson and me cut buttonwood all around Bay Sunday, run it over to Key West, three dollars a cord. I seen straight off that Ed. J. Watson meant to go someplace, I seen my chance, so I signed on to guide him down around the Islands. I was just back from a year down there, plume hunting for Chevelier; I turned that Frenchman over to Bill House. We was just young fellers then, a scant fourteen. No school on Chokoloskee so you went to work.<br><br>Folks ask, &#x201c;Would you have worked for Watson if you knowed about him what you know today?&#x201d; Well, hell, I don&#x2019;t know what I know today and they don&#x2019;t neither. With so many stories growed up around that feller, who is to say which ones was true? What I seen were a able-bodied man, mostly quiet, easy in his ways, who acted according to our ideas of a gentleman. And that was all we had, ideas, cause we had never seen one in this section, unless you would count Preacher Gatewood, who brought the Lord to Everglade back in 1888 and took Him away again when he departed, the men said. Some kind of a joke, wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me.<br>Most of our old Glades pioneers was drifters and deserters from the War Between the States who never got the word that we was licked. Moonshiners and plume hunters, the most of &#x2019;em. Thatch lean-tos and a skiff and pot and rifle, maybe a jug of homemade lightning for fighting off the skeeters in the evening. Had earth in a tub, made their fire in the skiff, had coffee going morning, noon, and night.<br><br>Man on the run who used the name Will Raymond was camped with a woman and her daughter in a palmetta shack on that big bend in Chatham River, living along on grits and mullet, taking some gator hides and egret plumes, selling bad moonshine to the Injuns. We seen plenty like Will Raymond in the Islands, knife-mouthed piney-woods crackers, hollow-eyed under wool hats, and them bony-cheeked tall women with lank black hair like horse mane. Go crazy every little while, shoot some feller through the heart. Will done that more&#x2019;n once in other parts, we heard, and got that habit. Seems the law wanted him bad&#x2014;dead or alive, as you might say. When deputies come a-hunting him out of Key West, Will said nosir, he&#x2019;d be damned if he&#x2019;d go peaceable, and he whistled a bullet past their heads to prove it, but he was peaceable as the law allows by the time the smoke cleared. The law invited the Widder Raymond to accompany his mangy carcass on a free boat ride to Key West, and she said, &#x201c;Thankee, boys, I don&#x2019;t mind if I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Old Man Richard Harden, then the Frenchman, was on Chatham Bend before him, and the Injuns before that; biggest Injun mound south of Chokoloskee Island. Most of the Bend was overgrowed cause none of &#x2019;em weren&#x2019;t farmers, and Mister Watson would cuss Will Raymond every time we went downriver, saying how pitiful it was to see that good ground going to waste. One day Mister Watson went ashore, made an offer for the quit-claim, and Raymond come out with a old musket, run him off. Fortnight later, a posse come a hundred mile north from Key West and killed that pesky feller, and next thing you know, Ed Watson tracked the widder down and bought the quit-claim, two hundred fifty dollars. That was a pile of cash in them days, but what he got was forty acres of good soil, protected on three sides by mangrove tangle: anybody who come huntin E. J. Watson would have to come straight at him, off the river.<br><br>E. J. Watson had grand plans, about the only feller down there as ever did. Used to talk about dredging out the mouth of Chatham River, make a harbor for that wild southwest coast. Meantime, he sunk buttonwood posts to frame up a new cabin, had wood shutters and canvas flaps on the front windows, brought in a woodstove and a kerosene lamp and a galvanized tub for anyone might care to bath. We ate good, too, fish and wild meat, sowbelly and grits, had a big iron skillet and made johnnycakes: put some lard to his good flour, cooked &#x2019;em up dry. I remembered them big johnnycakes all my whole life.<br><br>Will Raymond&#x2019;s shack weren&#x2019;t fit for hogs, Mister Watson said, had to patch it up before he put his hogs in it. We had two cows, and chickens, too, but that man had a real feel for hogs. He loved hogs and hogs loved him, come to his call from all over the Bend, I can hear him calling down them river evenings to this day. Brought &#x2019;em in at night cause of the panthers, fed &#x2019;em garden trash and table slops and such so they wouldn&#x2019;t get no fishy taste like them old razorbacks at Hardens that fed on crabs and lowlife when the tide was out. Kept a old roan horse to pull his plow, break that hard shell ground, and sometimes he&#x2019;d ride around his farm like it was his old family plantation back in South Carolina.<br><br>Mister Watson experimented with all kinds of vegetables and tobacco. Only victuals we traded for was salt and coffee: bought hard green coffee beans, wrapped &#x2019;em in burlap. hammered &#x2019;em to powder with a mallet. Made our own grits and sugar and cane spirits&#x2014;what we called white lightning. Seasons when vegetables done poor, we&#x2019;d pole inland up the creeks and out across the Glades to the piney ridges, get Injun greens and coontie root for starch and flour, cut some cabbage-palm tops in the hammocks. Worked his crew like niggers and worked like a nigger alongside of us. Brung in regular niggers from Fort Myers, and they worked hard, too&#x2014;that man knew how to get work from his help! Them boys was scared to death of him, he could be rough. But they sure liked to listen to his stories, least when he weren&#x2019;t drinking. Told &#x2019;em nigger jokes that set &#x2019;em giggling for hours&#x2014;nerves, maybe. I never did get them fool jokes. Me&#x2019;n niggers just don&#x2019;t think the same.<br>Ed Watson was the first man since the Injuns to hack down all that thorn on Chatham Bend. Dug out palmetta roots thick as his leg, raked the shell out of that black soil and made a farm. Grew all kinds of vegetables, grew cane for syrup, and tomatoes and then alligator pears. Chok folks hooted when he tried seed potatoes, but Mister Watson shipped them things for three-four years and almost made &#x2019;em pay, and never failed to raise a few for our own table.<br><br>We got good money for our produce but too much spoiled before it reached Key West, so pretty quick, we give up on common vegetables and stuck to sugarcane. Next he figured that making cane syrup right there on the Bend made a lot more sense than shipping heavy stalks, because syrup could be stored till he got his price. First planter in south Florida to let his cane tassel before harvest so the syrup would boil down stronger without sugaring. Burned off his field before harvest, too, figuring the work would go much faster once the leaves and cane tops was burned away: nothing but clean stalks to deal with, not much sugar lost, and a smaller crew. And he learned not to wait too long: he&#x2019;s the one discovered that cane sugar don&#x2019;t extract good from the stalks even a few days after the burn.<br><br>Locally we sold every jar of syrup we produced so we invested in a bigger schooner that he called the Gladiator, packed our syrup in screw-top gallon cans, six to the case, shipped &#x2019;em to Port Tampa and Key West. Island Pride! Our brand grew to be famous. Them fellers at Half Way Creek and Turner River made good syrup but our Island Pride had left &#x2019;em in the dust.<br><br>All this while we shot gators and egrets when they was handy. Up them inland creeks past Alligator Bay, white egrets was thick, pink curlew, too, and we never failed to take a deer for venison, sometimes a turkey. Trapped coons and otters, shot a bear or panther every little while. Mister Watson was a deadeye shot. I could shoot pretty good, too, but the only man in southwest Florida could shoot as quick and clean as E. J. Watson was Nigger Short.<br><br>When D. D. House moved his cane plantation from Half Way Creek down to a big hammock north of Chatham Bend, he took Short with him. Sundays, that boy might visit with Bill House at Possum Key or go to Hardens. Henry and me got on all right, I never held nothin against him, but them damn Hardens let that nigger eat right at their table.<br>Besides me and Mister Watson, the only man hunting plume birds in our section was the Frenchman. One day we seen Chevelier&#x2019;s skiff come out Sim&#x2019;s Creek that&#x2019;s back of Gopher Key. Sometimes that old man had Injuns with him, and this day I seen a dugout slide out of sight into the greenery.<br><br>Mister Watson never paid them Injuns no attention, only the skiff; he made me a sign to ship my oars, drift quiet. When Chevelier lifted his straw hat to mop his head, he shot it right out of his hand, just spun it away into the water. That old man yelped and grabbed his oars and skedaddled like a duck into the mangroves. &#x201c;Stay off my territory!&#x201d; shouts Watson. Picking up the floating hat with that new hole in it, he was grinning, kind of sheepish. Never a whisper from the mangroves and nothing to be seen but them red stilt roots, water glitter, and green air. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find your hat at Chatham Bend!&#x201d; he yells.<br><br>I told Mister Watson how Chevelier was collecting rare birds for museums, used small-gauge bird shot so as not to spoil the skins. The Frenchman had all kinds of books, knew all about Injuns, spoke some of their lingo; he had wild men visiting at Possum Key that would never go nowhere near Chokoloskee Bay. Traded their hides and furs through Richard Harden, who claimed to be Choctaw or some such, though nobody never paid that no attention. The Frenchman was always close to Hardens, and probably it was Old Man Richard who brought them Injuns to him in the first place.<br><br>All the while I was talking, Mister Watson watched me. That feller would look at you dead on for a long minute, then blink just once, real slow, like a chewing turtle, keeping his eyes closed for a moment as if resting &#x2019;em up from such a dretful sight. That&#x2019;s how I first noticed his fire color, that dark red hair the color of old embers or dried blood, and the ruddy skin and sunburned whiskers with a little gold to &#x2019;em, like he glowed inside. Then them blue eyes fixed me again, out of the shadow of that black felt hat. Only hat in the Ten Thousand Islands, I imagine, that had a label into it from Fort Smith, Arkansas. I took to whistling.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he up to over yonder, then?&#x201d; Mister Watson interrupts me. I told him about that Injun mound hid away on Gopher Key and the white shell lining the canal that come in there from the Gulf. My opinion, Chevelier was hunting Calusa treasure.<br><br>On the way home, he was quiet. Finally he said he wouldn&#x2019;t mind having him a chat with a educated man like Jean Chevelier&#x2014;Che-vell-yay, he called him, stead of Shovel-leer, the way us local fellers said it&#x2014;and he reckoned he&#x2019;d picked a piss-poor way to get acquainted. He was right. That old Frenchman had some sand or he wouldn&#x2019;t have made it all alone here in the Islands. This hat business weren&#x2019;t over by a long shot.<br><br>We hung that felt hat on a peg when we got home but the Frenchman never come for it. After that day, we had them plume birds to ourselves.</p><h2>At the Back of the North Wind</h2><p>At the Back of the North Wind is a brilliant allegorical tale by George MacDonald.

BOMC Main.</p><p>One of the most impressive aspects of Dick Francis's long and celebrated career (he's won three Edgar Awards, the Silver Dagger, the Gold Dagger, a Cartier Diamond Dagger, and was named the 1996 Mystery Writers of America Grand Master) is the freshness that he brings to each of his novels. Though every one of his 30-plus works of fiction has drawn from some aspect of the world of horses, Francis turns this constraint into a powerful source of inspiration. In <i>10 Lb. Penalty</i> Francis adds several new arrows to his quiver. His protagonist, Ben Juliard, narrates the tale in a vivid first person that begins in his insecure late teens instead of the settled middle age of the usual Francis hero. Also, Ben's relationship with horses is more of a fading dream than an active reality. The book begins with Ben's expulsion from Vivian Durridge's stables; he's removed with a false accusation of glue sniffing. But as Ben soon discovers, it is, in fact, his powerful father's machinations that are behind his ill fortunes. The elder Juliard is "standing for Parliament," and the bachelor candidate needs his son by his side for a year of campaigning if he hopes to win. Ben accedes to his father's wishes. He almost always has, but he soon finds that his "gap year"--his year before entering college--is going to be a nightmare. Orinda Nagle, the widow of the recently deceased Hoopwestern MP, and her companion, Alderney Wyvern, resist George's campaign from the start. Then, Usher Rudd, a muckraking journalist, turns his vitriol to George. When an attempt is made on George's life, he and his son find themselves inside a vigorous tale of suspense that takes several narrative years to sort out.<p> Francis's lucid prose is the driving force in this political mystery, and the realistic rendering of the complicated father-son relationship between George and Ben adds a sophistication and weight that marks the author's best fiction. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Dick Francis was one of the most successful post-war National Hunt jockeys.

Benson&#39;s witty and well-observed novel of varsity life set at King&#39;s College, Cambridge during the early part of the 20th century. The novel was first published in 1924 when Benson was in his later fifties. The work was penned by Benson because of the success he had enjoyed with David Blaize, his schoolboy novel, first published in 1916. David of King&#39;s takes off where David Blaize ends. The novel covers three years of Blaize&#39;s undergraduate life. Enjoy more tales of Blaize and his different friendships with Maddox and Bags as they live and learn together as King&#39;smen. David of King&#39;s is, above all, a &#34;jolly enjoyable&#34; read. Benson tells an absorbing story and he draws the reader into the cultural and social world of Blaize at King&#39;s College and more generally of Cambridge University. His stories of Blaize&#39;s encounters with colourful and eccentric dons--A.G. and Mr. Crowfoot--based on the real life characters O.B. (Oscar Browning) and Mr. J.E.

But in the last quarter of the twentieth century a revolution has taken place. Printers and designers throughout the world have jettisoned the old technology in favor of advanced filmsetting and desk-top systems, which introduce new problems and open up exciting possibilities for typographers.

The five-mile-wide wall of flames, borne on tornado-force winds of 100 miles per hour, tore across more than 2,400 square miles of land, obliterating Peshtigo in less than one hour and killing more than 2,000 people.<br><br><i>Firestorm at Peshtigo</i> places the reader at the center of the blow-out. Through accounts of newspaper publishers Luther Noyes and Franklin Tilton, lumber baron Isaac Stephenson, parish priest Father Peter Pernin, and meteorologist Increase Lapham -- the only person who understood the unusual and dangerous nature of this fire -- Denise Gess and William Lutz re-create the story of the people, the politics, and the place behind this monumental natural disaster, delivering it from the lost annals of American history.<br><br>Drawn from survivors' letters, diaries, interviews, and local newspapers, <i>Firestorm at Peshtigo</i> tells the human story behind America's deadliest wildfire.<br></p><p>Denise Gess, author of two critically acclaimed novels, is the visiting assistant professor of fiction writing at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. <br><br>William Lutz is a professor of English at Rutgers University, Camden, and author of fifteen books, including the bestseller <i>Doublespeak</i>. They live in Philadelphia.<br>In American history books, October 8, 1871, marks the massive fire that consumed Chicago. But as Gess (Good Deeds) and Lutz (Doublespeak) document in this thorough historical narrative, it was also the night a fledgling Wisconsin mining town endured a worse fate a story often overlooked in the annals of fire. Peshtigo, with a population of nearly 2,000, was obliterated in less than an hour that night by a freakish convergence of rampant forest fires and tornado-force winds. Gess and Lutz draw on a wealth of local sources, including diaries, interviews with survivors and newspaper accounts, to enliven their story and forge a cast of main characters. While the authors go into far too much detail in describing the town's founding and its politics, they render a chilling, absorbing account of the hellish events of the night itself, perhaps due to Gess's background as a novelist: " `Faster than it takes to write these words' is the phrase every survivor used. They used it to describe the speed of a fireball hitting a house and setting it into instant flames; they used it to describe the speed with which one house was lifted from its foundation, then thrown through the air `a hundred feet' before it detonated midflight and sent strips of flaming wood flying like shrapnel.... They used it to describe the sight of a small boy, separated from his family, and how he knelt to the ground, crouching in prayer before fire lit his body." The images of the catastrophe are often as unpleasant as they are vivid, but readers will sense that they are necessary and that Gess and Lutz have done an overdue service to those who suffered.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trouble is My Business</h2><p>Trouble is My Business is a collection of four riveting novellas from Raymond Chandler. In the first of the four cases LA PI Philip Marlowe is offered a job that leaves a bad taste in the mouth: smearing a girl who&#x2019;s &#x2018;got her hooks into a rich man&#x2019;s pup&#x2019;. Before too long Marlowe&#x2019;s up to his neck in corpses and cops and he&#x2019;s taken pity on the girl. There&#x2019;s nothing like making trouble of your business . . . The four novellas collected here are quintessential Raymond Chandler: slick, crystal-clear writing that pins the reader to the seat and won&#x2019;t let go until the last page is turned.</p><p>In the four long stories in this collection, Marlowe is hired to protect a rich old guy from a gold digger, runs afoul of crooked politicos, gets a line on some stolen jewels with a reward attached, and stumbles across a murder victim who may have been an extortionist.Raymond Thornton Chandler (1888 - 1959) was the master practitioner of American hard-boiled crime fiction. Although he was born in Chicago, Chandler spent most of his boyhood and youth in England where he attended Dulwich College and later worked as a freelance journalist for &#34;The Westminster Gazette&#34; and &#34;The Spectator,&#34; During World War I, Chandler served in France with the First Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, transferring later to the Royal Flying Corps (R. A. F.). In 1919 he returned to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually became director of a number of independent oil companies. The Depression put an end to his career, and in 1933, at the age of forty-five, he turned to writing fiction, publishing his first stories in &#34;Black Mask,&#34; Chandler&#39;s detective stories often starred the brash but honorable Philip Marlowe (introduced in 1939 in his first novel, The Big Sleep) and were noted for their literate presentation and dead-on critical eye. Never a prolific writer, Chandler published only one collection of stories and seven novels in his lifetime. Some of Chandler&#39;s novels, like The Big Sleep, were made into classic movies which helped define the film noir style. In the last year of his life he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. He died in La Jolla, California on March 26, 1959.</p><h2>Hold Back the Dark (Bishop/Special Crimes Unit)</h2><p><b>A town in the thrall of evil. A summons that can't be ignored.

She lives in North Carolina.Tuesday, October 7<br><br> Olivia Castle had experienced some monster headaches in her time, but this one, she felt sure, was about to make her head quite literally explode. It had come out of nowhere, as if something had just yanked her head into an invisible, tightening vise without warning. A vise with teeth. In pain, queasy, and shaking, she managed to lever herself up from the couch, holding one hand against the head she was sure was about to fall off, and hardly spared a moment to wonder why she'd been on the couch.<br><br> Work. She should have been at work.<br><br> Shouldn't she be at work?<br><br> Had she come home for lunch? She didn't remember.<br><br> Her head hurt too much to keep thinking about that.<br><br> She made it to the kitchen by holding on to various pieces of furniture as she passed, fighting nausea and accidentally grabbing Rex's tail when she gripped the edge of the sink.<br><br> "Waaaurr!"<br><br> "Sorry, sorry," she muttered, the headache so bad by then that her cat's cry sounded like a dozen angry crows, her own quiet voice sounded like booming thunder in her head, and even her vision was affected in some way she didn't understand; she couldn't see the pleasant Vermont view normally visible from this window. She couldn't see any real view at all.<br><br> She was seeing colors she was reasonably sure didn't exist in nature. Or anywhere else, for that matter. Moving, swirling, like colorful smoke driven by a capricious breeze, opaque and translucent by turn. And everything was so damned bright. "Shouldn't sit on the counter. How many times have I told you? Didn't see you, pal. Oh, damn, what is going on?"<br><br> There was a large economy-sized bottle of an OTC painkiller near the sink (just as there was one in almost every room of her small house, and in her purse, with a box of extra bottles in the storage closet, in case the zombie apocalypse came without warning and all the pharmacies got looted before she could get to them). Olivia closed her eyes against the unnatural brightness, fumbling the bottle open while bitterly cursing childproof caps foisted upon people who had no children, fumbled just as blindly for a glass and the faucet, and managed, finally, to swallow about eight pills, hoping she could keep them down long enough to do some good.<br><br> "Prrupp," Rex said.<br><br> "I know it's too many, you don't have to tell me that." She stood there, eyes still closed, still hanging on to the edge of the sink with one hand and her head with the other, trying to breathe normally despite the pain keeping all her muscles rigid and snatching at her ability to breathe at all, her stomach churning, the weird colors still swirling even though her eyes were closed, wishing pain meds took effect faster. Like immediately. It would have been nice, she thought, to just take a shot of morphine and become unconscious for the duration. But she'd discovered the hard way that both the law and doctors frowned on patients self-medicating, far less walking out the door of any hospital, clinic, or pharmacy with their own supply of morphine or any other industrial-strength painkiller. And besides, they said it was only migraines.<br><br> Only migraines. Only migraines. Jesus. Even though no migraine remedy known to medical science and quite a few exotic possibilities Olivia had experimented with herself had so much as touched her periodic killer headaches.<br><br> She fumbled blindly for the bottle again.<br><br> "Waauurr!"<br><br> "All right, all right. I know there hasn't been enough time. But if the pain doesn't stop soon, I'm gonna take more. Shit."<br><br> A moment later, Rex hissed.<br><br> Olivia managed to pry her eyes open no matter how much the ungodly brightness all around her hurt, and squinted at her cat in surprise. Because Rex didn't hiss, or at least never had. But as she focused on her rather odd-looking cat, his brindle-tortie coat at odds with the brilliant blue eyes of a Siamese, she realized even through the bright, swirling colors she was still seeing that Rex was scared.<br><br> Really scared.<br><br> And Rex didn't scare easily. Or . . . at all.<br><br> He was staring past her into the space behind her, the kitchen and den, and his pupils were so narrow that his eyes looked incredibly creepy, like the unnaturally blue eyes of a snake. The fur along his back was standing straight up, and his tail was about three times its natural size.<br><br> At the same time, Olivia began hearing a strange rustling sound. At first it sounded like dry leaves skittering along pavement, which was weird enough to hear inside her house with no pavement around. But then she realized it was . . . whispering. Lots of voices. Lots and lots of voices. Whispering.<br><br> It was coming from behind her.<br><br> Olivia did not want to turn around. Her mouth was dry despite the nausea, her skin was crawling unpleasantly, the pain in her head was getting impossibly worse rather than better, and she was afraid if she turned to confront an axe murderer, she'd beg him to just cut off her head and be quick about it.<br><br> Axe murderer. Idiot.<br><br> Not an axe murderer, of course. Not anyone.<br><br> Not any one . . . thing. Because she heard more than one whisper, many whispers, countless whispers. And she didn't know what they were saying, but she had the eerie feeling they were all whispering the same thing. The same words.<br><br> Still holding the edge of the sink with one hand, Olivia turned slowly to see what so frightened her cat and was making her own skin crawl in a sensation she'd never felt before.<br><br> "Oh, shit," she whispered.<br><br> The headache that was still hellishly painful didn't seem such a big deal now. Because despite all the swirling colors nearly blinding her, she could see, very clearly, why Rex was afraid. Every sharp object in her kitchen and den-every single one from every kitchen knife and fork she owned to three letter openers, two pairs of scissors, two box cutters with razor blades visible, the iron fireplace poker, and half a dozen pens and twice that many sharpened pencils-floated in midair. Different levels, some low, some as high as eye level.<br><br> With their pointy ends aimed right at her.<br><br> And they were all whispering.<br><br> "Waaurr," Rex muttered, his voice unusually quiet, questioning.<br><br> "I'm not doing it. I'd know if I were doing it, right? I always know. I have to concentrate to do it. I mean, unless I'm mad. Angry, not crazy. Though maybe crazy too. Because this has never . . . And, anyway, even if I'm mad, I don't . . . know how . . . to make anything . . . whisper."<br><br> Or how to stop it when she instinctively tried, an effort that was definitely not rewarded.<br><br> Unconsciously, both her hands lifted to her head, pressing as if to hold something in, because the headache suddenly grew horribly worse, impossibly worse, dragging a guttural groan from somewhere deep inside her, and through the bright swirl of colors that was beginning to truly blind her, she could still see all the scary-sharp weapons floating inexorably toward her.<br><br> Whispering.<br><br> What was whispering? Inanimate objects couldn't communicate, right? Not like this, at least.<br><br> The pain edged into agony, but even so she heard as if from a great distance her own shaking, pleading question.<br><br> "What? What are you saying? What do you want of me?"<br><br> And from the same great distance, she heard the whispered demand that made no sense to her.<br><br> Prosperity. Go to Prosperity.<br><br> They were still floating eerily toward her, all the pointy things that promised even more pain if they came much closer, and hard as she tried, Olivia couldn't do anything about it, couldn't stop it, couldn't see anything but them or hear anything except for that whispered demand.<br><br> Go to Prosperity.<br><br> Go to Prosperity.<br><br> Olivia heard one last thing: A moan of agony escaped her, and then everything went black.<br><br> Tuesday, October 7<br><br> Logan Alexander considered himself a man of hardheaded practicality, which to his way of thinking was ironclad proof that the universe had a twisted sense of humor. Because he was also a medium.<br><br> A medium.<br><br> And he hated being a medium. He hated being called a medium, being dragged from peaceful obscurity into an unwelcome spotlight of sorts, what he was and what he could do named if not understood, word spreading among those who scorned with suspicion and those who believed or desperately wanted to. Both always, always finding him eventually and making his life hell so that he'd have to pull up stakes again, usually in the middle of the night, and find another place to live, in another town or city or state where he could be anonymous again, just another stranger and left in peace. Until the next time he was found, and the lost ones began to seek him out again.<br><br> Not the "Can you contact my uncle George and ask him where he hid all the family money?" sort of questions that only made him impatient. Those were relatively easy to either avoid or else respond to with some bullshit answer that would satisfy the sort of people who would even ask that kind of silly question.<br><br> It was the truly lost ones that got to him, the religious who had lost their faith and needed proof of some kind of an existence after death. The parents hollow-eyed and haunted in a very human sense by the inexplicable and heartbreaking disappearance of a child. The widows and widowers bereft by the loss of the other half of themselves. And others, so many others, lost people who were desperately hopeful that he could help them.<br><br> He hated it.<br><br> But what he hated most about an ability way too many people with no understanding of what they were talking about called a gift or a curse (as if it could be anything so simple as either) was that he had absolutely no control over it. And he had been told by someone who did understand and should certainly know all about it that the "door" most mediums opened in order to communicate with the dead was, in him, always open.<br><br> Always. Or, hell, just missing entirely.<br><br> And also that mediums naturally attracted spirits. Whether they wanted to or not.<br><br> He didn't talk to the dead, certainly not willingly. They talked to him. Anywhere. Everywhere. No matter how hard he tried to ignore them. Persistent, insistent, often desperate. Dogging his steps. Showing up in different places. Making it impossible for him to go out to dinner, or to a theater and enjoy a play or movie. Impossible to attend a party, or even to date-or at least date the same woman more than once.<br><br> He'd learned that lesson the hard way, with too many first dates ending with a woman eyeing him uneasily because he'd spent too much time sending brief, fierce glares at nothing she could see past her shoulder or over her head, or at the empty chair at their table. Most were either too kind or too wary to say it aloud, but at least one date had told him frankly that she didn't see the sense in a second date since it was obvious he had more baggage than she did and she wasn't getting any younger.<br><br> And the last time an instant physical attraction had cut an evening short for energetic (if not desperate) sex in his bed, the lady had left before dawn after waking to find him sitting up in bed having a whispered but clearly angry argument with someone named Josephine.<br><br> His bedmate's name wasn't Josephine, he was wide-awake-and as far as the lady could see, nobody else was in the room. So she snatched up her clothing and ran.<br><br> Logan had not blamed her one bit. He was just grateful that she hadn't called the police to report an escaped lunatic.<br><br> At least a few before her had done something of the sort over the years, reporting him as potentially dangerous, or mentally ill, or just a man who had frightened them in an age when police were finally paying more attention to that sort of thing, leaving him to spend time in this jail or that "detention room" or in some clinic or other while the police and sometimes doctors got things sorted out to their satisfaction in the quest to determine whether he was actually a danger-to himself or others. Sometimes there were fines, sometimes an order for a psychiatric evaluation.<br><br> All because he could see and talk to the dead.<br><br> They stole any chance he had of living a normal life, these spirits, and while his sympathy was sometimes roused by a particularly sad or frightened spirit killed in some brutally unfair manner and desperate for his help, he seldom could do anything to help them, and that only added to his resentment.<br><br> At least most of them had had a shot at a normal life, before whatever unfair act or illness or accident had put them in the ground. Logan, on the other hand, could hardly get a normal day to himself. Impossible to do everyday things. Wherever he went, whatever he was doing, there was at least one dead person anxious to talk to him.<br><br> Like now. He was just blamelessly walking in the park near his current home in San Francisco, needing some morning air before he returned to the freelance IT work he did from his home office, because of course he couldn't work in a normal office setting with people all around him.<br><br> Besides, even the living had begun to wear on his nerves after a while.<br><br> Maybe especially the living.<br><br> He'd just wanted some air, that was all. And there was a dead guy walking beside him. Talking to him.<br><br> "She didn't mean to poison me, I'm sure," the older gentleman of about sixty was saying earnestly, for about the third time.<br><br> Logan paused on an arched footbridge and leaned his elbows on the wooden railing, gazing down at the happily burbling, man-made creek. A quick glance had shown him no one else was near, but he still kept his voice low; bitter experience had taught him that, as with dates, office jobs, and lovers, speaking aloud in public to people only he could see whenever normal people were within earshot too often meant a quick trip to the nearest loony bin, or at least a night in a cell.<br><br> Adding insult to injury, the cells too were always filled with dead people. Usually far more hostile than his living cellmates.<br><br> "Listen, buddy-"<br><br> "My name is Oscar."<br><br> Logan didn't bother telling him names didn't really matter. "Oscar, I don't know if your wife poisoned you-"</p><h2>Meet the Cars (Disney Pixar Cars)</h2><p>From&nbsp;exotic race cars&nbsp;to spy planes, kids will love meeting a whole new crew of vehicles from the <em>Cars </em>world.

His mission is to make up for all of the wrong he has done in his life by living daily in the light of the Lord. His story is one of grace, of forgiveness, of gratitude. For almost 30 years Darrell pursued a criminal lifestyle. As an IV drug user, a crack addict and an alcoholic, he had only one goal, to score his next fix, regardless of the cost to others. He engaged in forgery, pimping, stealing, scamming and lying to get to his next high. To meet Darrell today you would never guess that he is a man with a wicked past. The people he has helped over the past seven years believe him to be an angel. Ex-cons, former drug addicts, troubled youth, and homeless vagrants all know that they can call on Darrell for help, support, and acceptance. There is no need too great for Darrell to address, and no kindness too large for him to extend. Darrell credits the Lord for his complete transformation from criminal to Christian calling on the Creator with one small prayer, &#34;Lord, please take the taste for drugs and alcohol from me.&#34; With that request, his life was changed. To his very core, Darrell believes that the same miracle can be extended to anyone who has the courage to ask for it, and the faith to believe that they too can be free from the grip of mind-altering substances. After reading Darrell&#39;s story you too will believe that miracles can happen in your own life and the lives of those you love.</p><p></p><h2>Night Road</h2><p><p>For eighteen years, Jude Farraday has put her children's needs above her own, and it shows -- her twins, Mia and Zach are bright and happy teenagers.

A graduate of Wake Forest University and the University of Virginia School of Law, she lives in Atlanta with her family. </b></p> <p><b>Kristin Hannah (right) is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eighteen novels, including <i>Winter Garden</i>. She is a former lawyer turned writer and the mother of one son. She and her husband live in the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.</b></p> <p><b>Kristin Hannah:</b> Well, first, I have to say, Emily, that I am just the tiniest bit irritated with you. When I got the call to do this interview, I was thrilled, to say the least. It came at a really busy time for me--right after the holidays and we all know how crazy that is--and my work in progress was giving me fits. Then I picked up <i>Heart of the Matter</i>, and lost myself. No more writing, no more cooking, no getting my hair done or reading my email. Once I started the story I literally couldn't put it down. Brava, girlfriend, I say. Your characters are so real and compelling, and they always say exactly the right thing. With so much honest emotion, I just have to ask how much of your work comes from your own life? </p> <p><b>Emily Giffin:</b> It never fails to thrill me when someone responds to one of my novels--especially when it's another writer. Writers understand the alchemy involved in making up something from nothing. And I just finished your book, <i>Night Road</i>, and I found it so emotional, so moving, and so terrifying--especially since I have three young children who will someday be teenagers. In terms of how much does my work come from my own life, I would say that I'm absolutely inspired by people, places, conversations, relationships, and issues that I observe, and that the "what if" part of my novel is very much inspired by these things in my life. But the details of my plots and the specifics of my characters come from my own head. How about you, Kristin? I'll ask you the million-dollar question that every author gets asked: where do you get your ideas? </p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> Ah, the idea question. I don't want to sound coy, but the truth is, I don't quite know. It's the most magical part of the process for me. I'm a pretty analytical gal, and I approach writing in the same just-the-facts-ma'am way I approach most things. I need to find an issue that engages me on an intellectual level, and then I need to marry that curiosity with a kind of passion. I need to feel genuinely passionate about each story before I ever write a word, and I have to actually have something to say. It takes me at least a year to research and write a novel, and so I have to really adore each part of it--the characters, setting, story. Most of all, it has to make me feel something genuine. That's really the most important component. Usually it begins with a single "what if" question--what if you discovered your mother had a whole secret life about which you knew nothing (<i>Winter Garden</i>) or what if your husband were accused of a crime you believed he hadn't committed (<i>True Colors</i>)--and then I write and re-write until the characters seem as real to me as old friends.</p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> I'm amazed by how much we have in common. We're both moms, both lawyers, both lived in London for a time. You're like a younger, cooler version of me. How did you make the transition from lawyer to writer, and do you think you'll ever practice law again? </p> <p><b>Emily:</b> I would hardly say I'm cooler than you, Kristin! I hear you live in Hawaii part time! What is cooler than that? I made the transition from lawyer to writer because I was so miserable being a lawyer that I needed some escape from the day-to-day of it. And inventing stories was that escape. I can say, without hesitation, that I will never practice law again. Would you? What kind of law did you practice, and for how long? What did you find appealing (or discouraging) about law? Did you find that it gave you fodder for any of your novels? </p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> Honestly, I have met very few lawyers who don't say that what they really want to do is write. Like you, I can say with certainty that I will never practice law again. Not that anyone would want me to. But I still keep my Bar membership up...just in case this whole writing thing doesn't work out. And yes, in the past few years, I have finally begun to put some of that law school education to work for me. I find that I'm really enjoying adding legal issues to my work. Of course, I have to talk to <i>real</i> lawyers to make sure I'm getting it right... </p> Read more of the conversation between Emily Giffin and Kristin Hannah <br><br><b>Kristin Hannah</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of novels including <i>Firefly Lane</i>, <i>True Colors</i> and <i>Winter Garden</i>.

The German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917 forced the new French CinC General Nivelle to rethink and the French embarked on a major attack in the Aisne area and along the Chemin des Dames, with the British conducting large scale diversionary operations around Arras.<br><br>The French suffered disastrously and, rendered incapable of further offensive operations, it fell to the British to step up the pressure, which they did albeit at a terrible price.<br><br>This latest work by expert Jack Sheldon describes the event of Spring 1917 from the defenders&#x2019; perspective. In particular it reveals the methods the Germans used to smash the French attacks and Oberst Fritz von Lossberg&#x2019;s transformation of the defenses in the Arras front. Actions described in detail are the bitter battles around Monchy Le Preun, the Roeux Chemical works and Bullecourt as well as the capture of Vimy Ridge.</p><p>Educated at Inverness Royal Academy, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Universities of Lancaster and Westminster, Jack Sheldon completed a thirty-five year career as a member of the Queen&#x2019;s Lancashire Regiment.

Untold Story is a novel about family and friendship, intrigue and obsession, the meaning of identity, and the peculiar calamity of fame.</p><p>When Princess Diana died in Paris&#x2019;s Alma tunnel, she was thirty-seven years old. Had she lived, she would turn fifty on July 1, 2011. Who would the beloved icon be if she were alive today? What would she be doing? And where? One of the most versatile and bold writers of our time, Monica Ali has imagined a different fate for Diana in her spectacular new novel,&nbsp;<em>Untold Story</em>.&nbsp; <p>Diana&#x2019;s life and marriage were both fairy tale and nightmare rolled into one. Adored by millions, she suffered rejection, heartbreak, and betrayal. Surrounded by glamour and glitz and the constant attention of the press, she fought to carve a meaningful role for herself in helping the needy and dispossessed. The contradictions and pressures of her situation fueled her increasingly reckless behavior, but her stature and her connection with her public never ceased to grow. If Diana had lived, would she ever have found peace and happiness, or would the curse of fame always have been too great?&nbsp;</p> <p>Fast forward a decade after the (averted) Paris tragedy, and an Englishwoman named Lydia is living in a small, nondescript town somewhere in the American Midwest. She has a circle of friends: one owns a dress shop; one is a Realtor; another is a frenzied stay-at-home mom. Lydia volunteers at an animal shelter, and swims a lot. Her lover, who adores her, feels she won&#x2019;t let him know her. Who is she?&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Untold Story</em>&nbsp;is about the cost of celebrity, the meaning of identity, and the possibility&#x2014;or impossibility&#x2014;of reinventing a life. Ali&#x2019;s fictional princess is beautiful, intrepid, and resourceful and has established a fragile peace. And then the past threatens to destroy her new life. Ali has created a riveting novel inspired by the cultural icon she calls &#x201c;a gorgeous bundle of trouble.&#x201d; <br><br></p> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Joanne Harris Reviews <em>Untold Story</em></strong> <br> <p></p> <p><strong>Joanne Harris is the author of <em>Blueeyed Boy</em>, <em>The Lollipop Shoes</em> and <em>Chocolat</em>.</strong></p> <p>In <em>Untold Story</em>, Monica Ali has managed to do what the tabloids never did. She made me care about Diana. More than that, she made me admire the woman she has created out of the myth. This is a terrific, clever, multi-layered and subtle book (and let&#x2019;s not forget - hugely entertaining!), which deserves more acclaim than it has received so far.</p> <p><em>Untold Story</em> is a novel that can be read on many levels. At first glance, it&#x2019;s a thriller that taps into a number of female fantasies; reinvention, romance, adventure and the dark fairytale that was Diana, Princess of Wales &#x2013; a story that nearly all of us followed guiltily, in the tabloids, as its subject hurtled inevitably towards self- destruction. Looking beneath the surface, however, it becomes clear that <em>Untold Story</em> is much more than just a nicely-written piece of parallel tabloidery. It is a commentary on the nature of identity, of how we are judged, not by what we actually do, but by what we are perceived to be in a world where artifice rules and where truth matters less than story. It is about what it&#x2019;s like to be a troublesome, spirited woman in a world where women are meant to conform. It&#x2019;s about the choices a woman must make when trying to take control of her life. It&#x2019;s about letting go of the labels that others try to stick onto us. It&#x2019;s about fighting expectations &#x2013; a thing that the author herself has done, in her quiet way, ever since <em>Brick Lane</em> &#x2013; in the face of a vicious tabloid machine. It is a wonderful piece of subversion disguised as mere escapism, and I hope it sells millions.</p> <p></p> <br><b>Monica Ali </b>has been named by&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>&nbsp;as one of the twenty best young British novelists.

We had filled out our territorial boundaries, and the frontier was already encroaching upon the parched lands in the lee of the Rocky Mountains and moving east of the Sierra Nevadas. We were an industrial nation second only to Britain in manufacturing. Our expansion had been matched by an acceleration of economic well-being. The obstacles to American economic growth had been removed before the Civil War took place. That war was a costly and bitter interruption."<br><br> Integrating economic theory, history, and statistics in this provocative study, Professor North develops a fresh interpretation of the sources and determining factors of United States growth from the founding of the nation to the Civil War.<br><br> From 1970 to 1814 economic development is seen primarily as a result of external influences. From 1815 to 1860 the westward movement and the transformation to an industrial economy provided accelerating influences on the nation's growing prosperity. Professor North concludes that the export trade, particularly in cotton, was of prime importance as a stimulant to the economy. And he emphasizes the cornerstone of growth was the spread of a market economy, which attracted "an increasing percentage of resources into production for the market and out of pioneer self-sufficiency."</p><p></p><h2>The Sword of Shannara</h2><p>Long ago, the world of Shea Ohmsford was torn apart by the wars of ancient Evil.

His buildings in Glasgow, and especially his craggy masterpiece the Glasgow School of Art, are more complex and playful than anything in Britain at that time. His interiors, many of them designed in collaboration with his wife, Margaret Macdonald, are both spare and sensuous, creating a world of heightened aesthetic sensibility. Finally, during the 1920s, he painted a series of watercolours which are as original as anything he had done before. Since his death, Mackintosh has been lauded as a pioneer of the Modern Movement and as a master of Art Nouveau. This book, with illustrations that include specially prepared plans and sections, takes a clear-eyed view of Mackintosh and his achievement, stripping away the myths to reveal a designer of extraordinary sophistication and inventiveness.</p><p></p><h2>In a Dark, Dark Wood</h2><p><b>Someone's getting married.

Due to popular demand, <i>Absinthe: History in a Bottle </i>is back in paperback with a handsome new cover. Like the author's bestselling <i>The Martini </i>and <i>The Cigar,</i> it is a potent brew of wild nights and social history, fact and trivia, gorgeous art and beautiful artifacts. As intoxicating as its subject, <i>Absinthe</i> makes a memorable gift for anyone who knows how to celebrate vice.</p><p>Barnaby Conrad III is a painter and the author of ten books including Absinthe: History in a Bottle , published by Chronicle Books (0-8118-1650-8).<p> </p><p> Absinthe, as reviled in its time as crack cocaine is today, now seems the rather quaint forbidden fruit of a more innocent age. We think of <i> fin-de-si�cle</i> poets guzzling it in stagy despair or old paintings of stoned-out Parisians who don't look as if they're having that much fun slouched over their liqueur glasses. </p><p> But absinthe-drinking certainly was a drug scene. A serious <i>absintheur</i> would add the water to the liqueur slowly, pouring it over a sugar cube in an elaborate slotted spoon with a ritualistic absorption that reminds us of a junkie shooting up. </p><p> Like its non-scandalous descendant, Pernod, absinthe turned milky when mixed with water, with an opalescent greenish tone. Emerald green came to have the same implication of druggy ecstasy in the art of the 1890s that paisleys and mandalas had in the psychedelic '60s. </p><p> There is a curious history here, and Barnaby Conrad III recounts a lot of it in this fascinating book first published in 1988 and recently reissued by Chronicle Books. One of the things he makes you wonder is how people ever got addicted to a drink made from wormwood (apsinthium), a proverbially bitter herb best known as an insect repellent and cure for worms. Wormwood was an ingredient in many of the hopefully medicinal liqueurs people had been concocting since the Middle Ages. (Another of them, vermouth, actually gets its name from wormwood.) The one named absinthe had been made since the 1760s but didn't become controversial until a hundred years later. </p><p> The absinthe cult began, as Conrad explains, in the 1840s, when the French government issued absinthe to soldiers stationed in Algeria as a fever preventive. Some of them took to drinking it, let us say, recreationally and brought the custom back to Paris with them. </p><p> In the end, it became the symbol of decadence at a time when decadence was taken very seriously. As a result of the clamor, it was illegal just about everywhere by World War I. It is the only alcoholic beverage ever singled out by law as uniquely dangerous. </p><p> Along the way, many writers and painters had been seduced by absinthe. Most of Conrad's book consists of juicy anecdotes about famous artistic <i>absintheurs:</i> Early Symbolists like Beaudelaire, Rimbaud and (to show that even Americans could be decadent) Poe. Alfred Jarry, a forerunner of Dadaism who dressed like a bicycle racer and spoke like a robot. A whole parade of painters, including Van Gogh, whom it certainly did no good. One of the best things about this book is the illustrations -- 100 in black and white and 60 in color (leaning toward the green, of course). </p><p> The fact that French public opinion turned against absinthe was the strongest argument of the people who campaigned to outlaw it in other countries, but Conrad tends to side with those who think absinthe was the victim of hysteria in France. Unlike wine, it was a drink of the Industrial Age. Reformers and other worriers associated it with the squalor of the new urban slums, it played the same role in France that gin did in 18th century England. They saw it as an all-consuming plague, though it never actually accounted for more than 3% of the alcohol consumed in France. </p><p> On the other hand, some people were certainly getting messed up on it. Conrad points out that absinthe was bottled at 144 proof. Serious devotees of "the green fairy" hated to dilute it with much water, and the high level of alcohol alone could account for much of the damage. But then he quotes several attempts by literary <i>absintheurs</i> such as Oscar Wilde to describe the stages of absinthe intoxication, which involved mood swings and hallucinations that were evidently unlike plain drunkenness. </p><p> The obvious suspect was a component of wormwood named thujone which can, in sufficient quantity, cause epileptic-type convulsions. (Conrad wastes a little time trying to connect thujone with THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.) On the other hand, some 19th century scientists found that too much of anise, the main flavoring in absinthe, could be bad for you in itself. </p><p> In fact, most of the ingredients in absinthe and other medicinal liqueurs were harmful in excess. Conrad winds up with a maybe-this, maybe-that conclusion about what absinthism was all about. </p><p> At the end of the book, he describes finding an absinthe bootlegger in Switzerland and experiencing a grandiose absinthe intoxication. He says it made him feel he'd found the key to the mystery of life, but the next morning he couldn't remember what it was all about. </p><p> So it was an artificial paradise. It would be surprising to be told it wasn't. Anyway, we still have all those moody <i>fin-de-si�cle </i>paintings and juicy anecdotes. </p><p> -- <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, May 1997<br> </p><p> </p><p></p></p><h2>Denton Welch: The Making of a Writer</h2><p>1st edition, 1st printing HCDJ.

Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire was one of the most flamboyant and influential women of the eighteenth century. The great-great-great-great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales, she was variously a compulsive gambler, a political savante and operator of the highest order, a drug addict, an adulteress and the darling of the common people. This authoritative, utterly absorbing book presents a mesmerizing picture of a fascinating world of political and sexual intrigues, grand houses, huge parties, glamour and great wealth -- always on the edge of being squandered by the excesses and scandals of individuals.</p><p>Georgiana Spencer was, in a sense, an 18th-century It Girl. She came from one of England's richest and most landed families (the late Princess Diana was a Spencer too) and married into another. She was beautiful, sensitive, and extravagant--drugs, drink, high-profile love affairs, and even gambling counted among her favorite leisure-time activities. Nonetheless, she quickly moved from a world dominated by social parties to one focused on political parties. The duchess was an intimate of ministers and princes, and she canvassed assiduously for the Whig cause, most famously in the Westminster election of 1784. By turns she was caricatured and fawned on by the press, and she provided the inspiration for the character of Lady Teazle in Richard Sheridan's famous play <i>The School for Scandal</i>. But her weaknesses marked the last part of her life. By 1784, for one, Georgiana owed "many, many, many thousands," and her creditors dogged her until her death. <p> Biographer Amanda Foreman describes astutely the mess that surrounded the personal relationships of the aristocratic subculture (Georgiana and the duke engaged for many years in a m�nage � trois with Lady Elizabeth Fraser, who inveigled her way into the duke's bed and the duchess's heart). Foreman is, by her own admission, a little in love with her subject, which can lead to occasional lapses of perspective, but generally it adds zest to a narrative built on, rather than burdened by, scholarship, that is at once accessible and learned. An impressive debut, in every sense. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br>"Georgiana bursts from the pages of Amanda Foreman's dazzling biography like the force of nature she undoubtedly was--passionate, political, addicted to gambling, and drunk on life.

She lives in Stockholm. <i>A Faraway Island,</i> <i>The Lily Pond,</i> and <i>Deep Sea</i> are the first three novels in a quartet featuring the Steiner sisters, which has been translated into numerous languages and has garnered awards worldwide.Gr 6&#x2013;10&#x2014;Almost four years have passed since Stephie and Nellie Steiner, introduced in A Faraway Island (2009) and The Lily Pond (2011, both Delacorte), were sent from Nazi-occupied Vienna to Sweden by their parents. Letters from Vienna have stopped, replaced by periodic postcards from Theresienstadt containing exactly 30 words each. Stephie, now 16, is living on the mainland to attend grammar school, supported by the Swedish relief committee, while the younger Nellie remains on the island with Auntie Alma's family. The teen is torn between wanting to continue her education and feeling guilt at being away from Nellie, whose memory of their parents has given way to deepening bonds with her foster family. Overshadowing all is the protagonist's constant worry about her parents. Thor includes details that demonstrate how Sweden, though technically neutral, was nonetheless greatly affected by the surrounding war, and she deftly balances the sisters' everyday concerns with the greater psychological aspects of being refugees.

Maxwell chose deliberately to focus on biography, memoir, diaries, and correspondence when reviewing books: "what people said and did and wore and ate and hoped for and were afraid of, and in detail after often unimaginable detail they refresh our idea of existence and hold oblivion at arm's length." In reading his reviews, we are struck by Maxwell's skill in choosing the one particular, the haunting moment, that further illuminates our understanding of the power of an individual life. His discernment is equally telling whether writing about literary luminaries such as Virginia Woolf, Lord Byron, E.B. White, Isak Dinesen, or delving into the diaries of an unknown Victorian curate with vivid dreams of murder and mayhem.</p></p><p>With the publication of <i>The Outermost Dream</i>, a collection of essays by William Maxwell, Graywolf Press's Rediscovery Series has saved from obscurity yet another literary jewel. Most of these pieces originally appeared in the <i>New Yorker</i>, where Maxwell was a fiction editor for 40 years, on the occasion of the release of a biography, memoir, diary, or collection of correspondence by or about a noted (or not-so-noted) author. Maxwell brings such a stunning combination of intellect and passion to his subject matter that his essays (one can hardly call them mere book reviews) are, as Maxwell expects of great writing, astonishing. Each is a sharply focused miniature, allowing the reader to enter the world that Maxwell describes, whether it be that of a humble 19th-century curate-cum-diarist or the young V. S. Pritchett, who published his first work, a joke in the Paris <i>Herald</i>, while working as a stock clerk for a photographic-plate manufacturer.

Baldwin (1898-1981) was a&nbsp;professor of American history at the University of Pittsburgh and an authority on the history of western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Baldwin was director of the Western Pennsylvania Historical Survey, which produced 10 books in the late 1920's and 30's on the region's history.<p>THE OFFENSE</p><br> &nbsp;<br><p>From WHISKEY REBELS, by Leland D. Baldwin, �1939 by University of Pittsburgh Press, 1967 by Leland D. Baldwin. Used by permission of the University of Pittsburgh Press.</p><p>In 1790, the new national government of the United States was attempting to establish itself. Because the government had assumed the debts incurred by the colonies during the Revolution the government was deep in debt. During the 1791 winter session of Congress both houses approved a bill that put an excise tax on all distilled spirits. United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed the bill to help prevent the national debt from growing. Loud protests from all districts of the new nation soon followed. These protests were loudest in the western counties of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Acceptance of the excise tax varied with the scale of the production; large producers, who produced alcohol as a business venture, were more willing to accept the new tax. They could make an annual tax payment of six cents per gallon. A smaller producer, who only made whiskey occasionally, had to make payments throughout the year at a rate of about nine cents per gallon. Large producers could reduce the cost of the excise tax if they produced even larger quantities. Thus, the new tax gave the large producers a competitive advantage over small producers.</p><p>The smaller producers, who were generally in the western counties, had a very different perspective of the tax. To them the tax was abhorrent. The frontier farmers detested the excise because it was only payable in cash, something rare on the western frontier. Due to the great effort required to transport any product over the mountains back to the markets of the East, farmers felt it made much more sense to transport the distilled spirits of their grain rather than the raw grain itself.</p><p>THE REBELLION</p><p>The Whiskey Rebellion took place throughout the western frontier. There was not one state south of New York whose western counties did not protest the new excise with some sort of violence. Probably the biggest concern about the excise tax was the revenues from it would support a national government the western people felt was not representing them well. Their grievances involved resolving the Indian problems and opening the Mississippi River to navigation. "They were 'convinced that a tax upon liquors which are the common drink of a nation operates in proportion to the number and not to the wealth of the people, and of course is unjust in itself, and oppressive upon the poor.'" Without solving these problems the national government could expect no compliance to he excise law.</p><p>People in the West resisted the excise tax with different attitudes. Most simply refused to pay the tax while others rebelled with violence. Excise officers received most of the fury from the rebels. Each officer was to open an office in his county of operation. The easiest form of nonpayment was to prevent the excise officer from establishing an office in the county. To do this, rebels threatened anyone who offered to house the excise office. More often than not, the excise officer received threats to his well being. These threats were usually enough to discourage the officer from staying and trying to collect the tax. When an officer was brave enough to stay, the residents who opposed the tax committed such humiliations as tarring, feathering, and torturing the offender. This usually convinced the excise officer to leave the area.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA'S ROLE</p><i>"Western Pennsylvania was 'a center of terrorism under the guiding hand of Albert Gallatin.'"</i><p>Robert Hendrickson</p>The residents of western Pennsylvania played a major role in the "Whiskey Rebellion." It was the violent reaction of the people in this area that compelled President George Washington to call 12,950 militia men to suppress the rebellion in 1794. The residents of western Pennsylvania not only threatened the excise tax collectors, they proceeded to carry out their threats. An angry mob marched on collector John Neville's house in Washington County, had a shoot out with him and his slaves, and eventually burned his home. Fortunately, Neville narrowly escaped the grasp of the crowd. Not only did this mob attack the tax collector but they also stole the mail from a post rider leaving Pittsburgh. The logic behind this action was to discover who in the local area opposed the rebels. This was a federal offense for which the rebels could be prosecuted. Their actions of civil disobedience should not be considered as totally without justification. <p>ALBERT GALLATIN'S ROLE</p><br> &nbsp;<br><br> Since the people of western Pennsylvania felt they were not being well represented by Congress they decided to choose their own assembly. Each county was to choose between three and five representatives. These people were to bring the demands of their county to the assembly. Many of the representatives had ill feelings toward the national government. These people tried to push the residents of western Pennsylvania toward open insurrection. Men such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge and Albert Gallatin were the moderating force at these meetings and prevented the radicals from dominating the proceedings. Albert Gallatin's role was as a representative of the residents of Fayette County. As such he had to transmit the sentiment of the meetings even though he may have disagreed. Gallatin served as secretary and also delivered speeches that helped to pacify those radicals who were at the meetings. Often Gallatin delivered these speeches while radicals were in the crowd with their weapons in hand. Gallatin spoke about the mistake of open rebellion toward the government.<p>Unfortunately for Gallatin, the government officials did not differentiate between the moderates and the radicals who took part in these meetings. Participation brought guilt as far as those in the government were concerned. In 1794 the militia called by Washington marched to dispel the rebels in western Pennsylvania. They also brought a list of names of participants that certain members of the Presidential staff wanted arrested. This list included Brackenridge and Gallatin. Twenty rebels were arrested. Fortunately, Albert Gallatin was not among them. Of the twenty rebels arrested, none were found guilty. The fact that he was included on the list of rebels caused Albert Gallatin in later reflections to call his participation in the Whiskey Rebellion his <i>"only political sin."</i></p></p><h2>The Dungeons of Torgar (Lone Wolf)</h2><p>Readers become Lone Wolf, a fierce warrior who is involved in all sorts of sword and sorcery adventures, in this role-playing fantasy book</p><p></p><h2>The Kings&#39; Mistresses: The Liberated Lives of Marie Mancini, Princess Colonna, and Her Sister Hortense, Duchess Mazarin</h2><p><p></p><p>The Mancini Sisters, Marie and Hortense, were born in Rome, brought to the court of Louis XIV of France, and strategically married off by their uncle, Cardinal Mazarin, to secure his political power base. Such was the life of many young women of the age: they had no independent status under the law and were entirely a part of their husband&#x2019;s property once married. &nbsp;</p>Marie and Hortense, however, had other ambitions in mind altogether. Miserable in their marriages and determined to live independently, they abandoned their husbands in secret and began lives of extraordinary daring on the run and in the public eye. The beguiling sisters quickly won the affections of noblemen and kings alike. Their flight became popular fodder for salon conversation and tabloids, and was closely followed by seventeenth-century European society. The Countess of Grignan remarked that they were traveling &#x201c;like two heroines out of a novel.&#x201d; Others gossiped that they &#x201c;were roaming the countryside in pursuit of wandering lovers.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their scandalous behavior&#x2014;disguising themselves as men, gambling, and publicly disputing with their husbands&#x2014;served as more than just entertainment. It sparked discussions across Europe concerning the legal rights of husbands over their wives.Elizabeth Goldsmith&#x2019;s vibrant biography of the Mancini sisters&#x2014;drawn from personal papers of the players involved and the tabloids of the time&#x2014;illuminates the lives of two pioneering free spirits who were feminists long before the word existed.&nbsp;<br><p></p></p><p><p></p><b>Elizabeth C.

Now, <b>Color Theory Made Easy</b> presents an alternative approach that cuts through the tangle of established but contradictory concepts that gives artists a universal theory that really applies to their work. Most artists have been taught that red, blue, and yellow are the primary colors&#x2014;hues that cannot be created from any combination of other colors. However, as a result of years of study, author and artist Jim Ames has concluded that the true primary colors are cyan (a greenish blue), magenta (a violet red), and a yellow that does not learn toward either cyan or magenta.<br>In <b>Color Theory Made Easy</b>, Ames explains the importance of these three colors as the basis for all our thinking about color. Using friendly, clear language and colorful diagrams, the author lays the foundation in Chapter 1 for applying his color theory in art. He shows that all colors in nature are composed of varying percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Chapter 2 builds on this with a survey of the pigment colors artists actually use. Here the author offers an essential education concerning paint selection, and he lists currently available tube colors that are the most accurate in terms of the true primaries. The final chapter explores color mixing principles based on cyan, magenta, and yellow, and applies these principles through a series of watercolor demonstrations.<br>In this illuminating book, Jim Ames has broken new ground and given us a workable color theory that is both simple and indispensable.</p><p><b>Jim Ames</b> is a graphic designer, illustrator, and watercolorist.

In this story from the Choctaw People, Tim Tingle shows that it was not being slow and steady that won Turtle the big race, it was those feathers!!!</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;Variations of the race between the tortoise and the hare crop up regularly, but this version, retold as a trickster tale, stands out for its humor and expressive illustrations. Here, the rabbit only thinks he raced a turtle. In fact, it was a flying turkey wearing Turtle's shell. Also a porquoi tale, the story begins when Turkey steps on Turtle's back, breaking his shell into pieces. Turkey recruits an army of ants to mend it with cornsilk, and the shell transforms from a swirl into its familiar geometric pattern. In appreciation, Turtle allows Turkey to try it on just as Rabbit appears, itching for a race. The rest is history, though few have heard the historic event retold quite like this. The prose alternates between rhyming and nonrhyming text and for the most part it bounces along without stumbling. A few lines feel manipulated to create the rhyme, such as 'What is it?' asked Turtle, his eyes opened wide./'Here comes Rabbit,' said the Little Bitty Five./'Rabbit wants to race, and he won't be denied.' Bright cartoon illustrations capture the tale's humor and energy. Turkey explodes off the page as he emerges from Turtle's shell, ready to run. The animals' various emotions are well rendered, including Turtle's chagrin, Rabbit's aggression and later humiliation, and the budding friendship between Turtle and Turkey. Use this book as a variation to a common folktale, an introduction to Native American lore, or as a fine read-aloud all on its own.&#x2013;<i>Suzanne Myers Harold, Multnomah County Library System, Portland, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sidebars expand on some; for example, the Sixth Amendment is accompanied by a brief look at the Miranda Statement. It's a good overview of one of our founding documents and will prepare readers for single titles such as those in "The Bill of Rights" series (ABDO, 2008). Taking the Common Core standard regarding "the relationship between a primary and secondary source" to heart, Magna Carta begins by defining primary and secondary sources and identifying the document as an important primary source. Baxter explains that the ideas expressed in the Magna Carta influenced the authors of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. A later section outlines some specific ways in which the liberties granted in it are incorporated into U.S. law. The books cited in the "Find Out More" section offer information on medieval life and the American Revolution, but not the Magna Carta itself. Despite a few minor flaws, this title may be of interest where the curriculum allows for a more thorough study of the history of U.S. founding documents. Most of Sonneborn's material is standard fare: an outline of the causes of the Revolutionary War, the initial failure of the Articles of Confederation, and the ultimately successful Constitutional Convention. Each of the seven articles is discussed, as is the Bill of Rights and later amendments. An explanation of primary and secondary sources includes a useful description of when and why a historian might use each type.

The higher self, the soul and personality, higher mystical experience and cosmic consciousness are all examined. The author tells us: &#34;I have written this book because the testimony of those who have had moments or mystical experience seem to me a clear pointer to the truth of the world. I find these testimonies impressive in their sincerity, in their unanimity, and in their influence on the lives of those to whom they came. It is satisfying to have the assurance that (in William James&#39;s words), &#39;the inmost nature of reality is congenial to powers which we possess.&#39; But for everyone who has had such a glimpse there are 1000 who would desire it, but have had none. Immersed in the routine and monotony of everyday life, uninspiring and uninspired, they feel remote from such experience.&#34; This book is for those people. &#34;In most religions the ultimate verities are believed-and may therefore be doubted; in mysticism they are experienced, and doubt is no longer possible.&#34; ~ Swami Vivekananda</p><p></p><h2>Herculaneum: Italy&#39;s Buried Treasure</h2><p>Recounts how the same eruption that destroyed Pompeii buried the nearby city of Herculaneum, and recreates, through recent archaeological findings, the daily lives of those first century Romans</p><p></p><h2>Children of the Vampire</h2><p>Hoping to save his human son from the family duty of serving the evil Prince Vlad, vampire Arkady Tsepesh comes out of hiding, but his arrival is too late to save the young man from being kidnapped by Dracula</p><p>The second book in a vampire trilogy from the acclaimed author of <i>Covenant With The Vampire</i>, <i>Children Of The Vampire</i> is a dark, stylishly erotic prequel to Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>; it is the haunting tale of a struggle to end Dracula's control over his human descendants.The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

It reverberated throughout Western capitals, shattering the media&#39;s self-illusions about impartiality, objectivity, fairness and truth and provoked an unprecedented reaction and backlash from media organizations, journalistic societies, academics and government leaders, leading to street protests in Europe, and even a &#34;press trial&#34;!</p><p>Mr. Brock&#39;s career as a newspaper journalist for more than 30 years is highlighted by 17 professional awards - including being named a finalist for the 1989 Pulitzer Prize competition in Public Service. Recognized as a political and environmental writer and investigative reporter, Mr. Brock holds the Southern Journalism Award for Investigative Reporting (Duke University), the Thomas L. Stokes Award for Environmental Reporting of the Washington Journalism Center, and other distinctions. He has widely traveled the Balkans, Western Central Europe, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and other regions since 1976. A specialist in the role of the Western media in the Balkan wars, Mr. Brock&#39;s controversial articles and reports were reprinted in major newspapers worldwide. He appeared on nationally-televised panel discussions that focused on the Yugoslav wars, and he was interviewed by numerous domestic and international newspapers, television and radio. He began his newspaper career at The Philadelphia Inquirer, served for 20 years with The El Paso (Texas) Herald-Post, and wrote/reported/edited for newspapers in New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, D.C. ENDORSEMENT: Those of us who served as UN commanders in Bosnia realized the majority of the media reports were biased to say the least. Whenever we tried to set the record straight we were and continue to be accused of being, &#34;Serbian agents,&#34; refreshing to see a journalist, not a general, dispel some of the myths that characterized the professional propaganda paid for by two sides in a three-sided civil war. -- Lewis MacKenzie, Major General (ret�d) UNPROFOR Chief of Staff and Commander Sector Sarajevo March to August 1992 Author of, Peacekeeper: The Road to Sarajevo, 1993.Peter Brock has done a masterful job through patient and unbiased documentation and cool, logical reporting highlighting the great failure of the media in fairly and accurately covering the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. As someone intimately involved in covering the wars of the 1990s in the Balkans, I can attest that Brock s writing is restrained and, if anything, understated. His indictment of the media for its bias contribution to the start and ongoing conduct of the war is valid. That there were genuine initial misunderstandings on the part of the world s media with regard to the Balkan situation is clear. But the fact that the media on whose judgments governments made policies allowed itself to be duped by propagandists, and that editors then refused to recant when their errors became obvious: there lies the essence of Brock s indictment.<p> The free press of the world fought to be recognized as the guardian of truth and as a pillar of good governance. It cannot now deny culpability and reject criticism, or avoid the growing sentiment that it as with all aspects of public life requires constant review, and reform. It is evident from Brock s vital and eminently readable book that for freedom to perish, all it takes is for the media to exempt itself from its ethical responsibility toward impartiality. If Watergate was the modern starting point for agenda-based reporting, then the Balkan wars showed that, unchecked, the media could, without accountability, bring about the downfall of nations. The resultant emergence of terrorist coordinating centers in the Balkans, intimately involved in the 9/11, Madrid, and London attacks, can be laid directly at the door of the editors who allowed bias to rule their coverage of the Balkan wars.</p><p> We have yet to see the full consequences of the media s shameful unprofessionalism in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. But to start to remedy the problem it is essential that Brock s Media Cleansing: Dirty Reporting be widely read, and its message taken to heart. Peter Brock s book should be the basis for both Congressional and independent media enquiries. --Gregory R. Copley, Editor Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs<br><br>(General) Lewis MacKenzie expected journalists to call him frequently in Etobicoke, but what he did not expect were the kinds of questions they asked. What is interesting is that most of the calls now deal more with: "Could you tell us again what happened on such and such a date because we are taking another look at the way we covered it in our reporting." My message to them when they start wallowing in their anguish is. "Do not feel too guilty about all of this because you only reported what you saw, and what you saw was only 150 meters on either side of the Sarajevo Holiday Inn." --Lewis MacKenzie, Major General (retd) UNPROFOR<br><br>Peter Brock s devastating portrayal of the role played by western journalists in distorting the truth about what was really happening during the break up of Yugoslavia is a major accomplishment. The book underlines the terrible power of the media in influencing governments to make unwise policy decisions affecting the very course of history. It also exposes the close affinity that exists between media and government. Both are capable of telling lies and both are unwilling to admit mistakes. This is a must read book. It is a sad and shameful story but one that should be mandatory reading by every politician and by every practicing and aspiring journalist. --James Bissett, Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia (1990-1992).</p></p><h2>Punk House: Interiors in Anarchy</h2><p>The &#x201c;punk house&#x201d; may come in any number of forms. The most common type is often where a large group of like-minded punks cram into a house usually intended to accommodate two or three people, resulting in low rent and, thus, extended hours of leisure for the residents to pursue their true interests. <br><br><i>Punk House</i> features anarchist warehouses, feminist collectives, tree houses, workshops, artists&#x2019; studios, self-sufficient farms, hobo squats, community centers, basement bike shops, speakeasies, and all varieties of communal living spaces. In over 300 images of fifty houses in twenty-five cities in the US, photographer Abby Banks finds the already weathered face of a seventeen-year-old runaway; the soft hands of a vinyl junkie (record collector); the mohawked show-goer; the dirty dishes in the sink; silk screened posters on the wall; and many other revealing glimpses of these anarchist interiors.</p><p>Abby Banks is an artist based in Brattleboro, VT.

Dozens of schools of thought have arisen and thousands of books have been written on the nature of our personalities, our development, our relationships and our inner well-being. All of this has been of interest (and sometimes of concern) to Christians because of the importance we place on a correct understanding of human nature. Psychology often seems disconnected from, if not antithetical to, Christian perspectives on life. How do we relate our cherished Christian beliefs about persons to what secular versions of psychology tell us? In this book are gathered four models of the relationship of psychology and Christianity. David Powlison (Westminster Theological Seminary) offers the biblical counseling model. The levels-of-explanation model is advanced by David G. Myers (Hope College), while Gary Collins (former executive director of American Association of Christian Counselors) introduces the integration model. The Christian psychology model is put forth by Robert C. Roberts (Baylor University). Each of the contributors responds to the other essayists, noting points of agreement as well as problems they see. Editors Eric L. Johnson and Stanton L. Jones also provide an introduction to the history of Christians and psychology as well as a conclusion that considers what might bind the four views together and how a reader might evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each view.</p><p>Eric L. Johnson (Ph. D., Michigan State) is associate professor personality and theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, and is a frequent contributor to the Journal of Psychology and Theology. <p>Stanton L.

She's been outrunning boys and standing up for picked-on children ever since she was a girl--no matter how much her prideful, arrogant schoolmate Luke Bontrager insulted her. So Poppy certainly doesn't need his interference now, especially since he's made it plain he prefers demure, ladylike companions. In fact, if Luke doesn't stop helping her find the culprit--and growing humble and remorseful--she'll be forced to notice how handsome his change-of-heart is making him.

It was a turbulent and confusing time. As British and American politicians struggled to reach a compromise, events on the ground escalated until war was inevitable. McCullough writes vividly about the dismal conditions that troops on both sides had to endure, including an unusually harsh winter, and the role that luck and the whims of the weather played in helping the colonial forces hold off the world's greatest army. He also effectively explores the importance of motivation and troop morale--a tie was as good as a win to the Americans, while anything short of overwhelming victory was disheartening to the British, who expected a swift end to the war. The redcoat retreat from Boston, for example, was particularly humiliating for the British, while the minor American victory at Trenton was magnified despite its limited strategic importance. <p> Some of the strongest passages in <i>1776</i> are the revealing and well-rounded portraits of the Georges on both sides of the Atlantic. King George III, so often portrayed as a bumbling, arrogant fool, is given a more thoughtful treatment by McCullough, who shows that the king considered the colonists to be petulant subjects without legitimate grievances--an attitude that led him to underestimate the will and capabilities of the Americans. At times he seems shocked that war was even necessary. The great Washington lives up to his considerable reputation in these pages, and McCullough relies on private correspondence to balance the man and the myth, revealing how deeply concerned Washington was about the Americans' chances for victory, despite his public optimism. Perhaps more than any other man, he realized how fortunate they were to merely survive the year, and he willingly lays the responsibility for their good fortune in the hands of God rather than his own. Enthralling and superbly written, <i>1776</i> is the work of a master historian. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i> </p><p> <strong>The Other 1776</strong> </p><p> With his riveting, enlightening accounts of subjects from Johnstown Flood to John Adams, David McCullough has become the historian that Americans look to most to tell us our own story. In his Amazon.com interview, McCullough explains why he turned in his new book from the political battles of the Revolution to the battles on the ground, and he marvels at some of his favorite young citizen soldiers who fought alongside the remarkable General Washington. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>The Essential David McCullough</strong> </p><table> </table><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> <i>John Adams</i></td> <td> <br> <i>Truman</i></td> <td> <br> <i>Mornings on Horseback</i></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br> <i>The Path Between the Seas</i></td> <td> <br> <i>The Great Bridge</i></td> <td> <br> <i>The Johnstown Flood</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong>More Reading on the Revolution</strong> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> <i>The Great Improvisation</i> by Stacy Schiff</td> <td> <br> <i>Washington's Crossing</i> by David Hackett Fischer</td> <td> <br> <i>His Excellency: George Washington</i> by Joseph J.

Beaton&#39;s identification of the young Mick Jagger as a &#39;Tarzan Piero di Cosimo&#39; was inspired and revealing. This was, in its way, a kind of love affair, and Beaton&#39;s ability to see his new hero both as a Renaissance jungle boy and as a shy young lady up from the suburbs is well matched by Vickers sensitive choice of photographs.&#39; -- Miranda Seymour THE SUNDAY TIMES (12.10.03) &#39;Beaton&#39;s diaries are perhaps unique in offering such a double vision of the 1960s - of the rich and famous, young and old, viewed through a technician&#39;s lens.&#39; -- Patrick O&#39;Connor LITERARY REVIEW (November) &#39;Hugo Vickers has edited the diaries quite brilliantly, alloting most space to those characters - Chanel, Garbo, Picasso, Streisand, Jagger - who still ring a bell, and providing absorbing and often very comical footnotes for those who do not.&#39; **** -- Craig Brown MAIL ON SUNDAY (30.11.03) &#39;The original diaries...are dynamite.

Born a Creek, young Osceola was driven from his home by General Andrew Jackson to Spanish Florida, where he joined the Seminole tribe. Years later, President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which was not only intended to relocate the Seminoles to hostile lands in the West but would force the return of runaway slaves who had joined that tribe. Osceola&#x2015;outraged at the potential loss of his people and homeland&#x2015;did not hesitate to declare war on the United States.</p><p><i>Osceola and the Great Seminole War</i> vividly recounts how one warrior with courage and cunning unequaled by any Native American leader before or after would mastermind battle strategies that would embarrass the best officers in the United States Army. Employing daring guerilla tactics, Osceola initiated and orchestrated the longest, most expensive, and deadliest war ever fought by the United States against Native Americans. With each victory by his outnumbered and undersupplied warriors, Osceola's reputation grew among his people and captured the imagination of the citizens of the United States. At the time, many cheered his quixotic quest for justice and freedom, and since then many more have considered his betrayal on the battlefield to be one the darkest hours in U.S. Army history.</p><p>Insightful, meticulously researched, and thrillingly told, award-winning author Thom Hatch's account of the Second Seminole War is an extraordinarily accomplished work of American history that finally does justice to one of the greatest Native American warriors.</p></p><p><p>THOM HATCH is an award-winning author and historian who specializes in the American West, the Civil War, and Native American conflicts.

One by one they cautiously raised their heads to view great plumes of charcoal smoke furiously billowing upward into the distant sky. This fear-inspiring sight indicated that countless fires were raging in the direction of their homes. It was apparent that every residence and building in the town of Tallassee along the Tallapoosa River in the region of present-day Macon County, Alabama, had been set on fire and was burning out of control. Soon nothing would remain but ashes and debris.<br>These displaced people had been on the move for two days, abandoning their town when word was received that the soldiers were on their way. They had been hiding in various places within the thick underbrush between the Tallapoosa and Coosa rivers, waiting for the time when they could return to their homes. They had survived thus far by scavenging whatever they could find in fields or abandoned villages that still stood, or resorting to stealing when the opportunity arose. It was likely that Billy Powell and the other boys helped provide meat by hunting squirrel, rabbit, or other small game with their bows and arrows.<br>These desperate Creeks, however, now were struck with the gravity of their situation&#x2014;it could be assumed that all their homes and the town community buildings had been consumed by the fire and they were homeless and in the hands of fate.<br>There were no tears or wailing or shouts of anger and revenge. It was imperative that they remain quiet, secreted, and focused. The U.S. Army invaders who had perpetrated this tragedy upon them would be combing the area to search for the missing inhabitants of this town. The purpose of those soldiers raiding any Creek town was not only to destroy homes and possessions but also to take lives, and this enemy had proved itself extraordinarily brutal and heartless. Even young Billy Powell understood that if any of the Tallassee Creeks were found, they surely would be killed.<br>The faces of the Creek refugees were grave. No one dared speak the words, but each stunned member of this band was aware that they would be compelled to flee without delay from their homeland&#x2014;perhaps permanently. They had no home to go back to now that their town had vanished into smoldering ruins, and the soldiers would make certain that Tallassee and any other Upper Creek town they destroyed would never be rebuilt or reoccupied. Billy Powell and his Creek neighbors must try to forget about the loss of their town and possessions and focus all their efforts on escaping from this dangerous place.<br>Such a desperate assessment was not easy to make, nor would flight to a new place be a simple undertaking. The town of Tallassee had been their traditional home for generations. Where could they go, under duress and on a moment&#x2019;s notice, without any possessions other than those they carried on their backs? This question was not spoken aloud but was foremost on everyone&#x2019;s minds. These Creek people were not by any means prepared for an extended journey. The country beyond was rife with danger from extreme elements, from vicious wild animals, from their enemies, from an unforgiving tangled and soggy terrain of swamps and forests, and most of all from the unknown.<br>Billy Powell watched the final visible vestiges of smoke rise against the blackening sky. It was difficult for him to imagine that everything he knew in life had been destroyed. His mind might have drifted back to relive the memories of his well-ordered childhood in that pastoral place along the Tallapoosa River. He likely could not fathom the fact that he would never again lay eyes on that town and its environs that had become so familiar to him and offered him a sense of security.<br>Billy&#x2019;s people had lived in that place for as long as anyone could remember. The written history of the Creeks had its foundations in narratives of de Soto&#x2019;s expedition in 1540, but they were much older than that. The Creeks were descendants of the Mississippian culture, the first great civilization in North America, which arose some four thousand years before the Spanish arrived. These prehistoric Muskogees or Muscokees and affiliated tribes were known to build earthwork mounds at regional chiefdoms that spread across two-thirds of the United States.<br>By the time of de Soto&#x2019;s landing on the islands of coastal Georgia, however, the Muskogean people, who would become known as Creeks, no longer built mounds and had established a confederacy that occupied the greater portion of Alabama and Georgia. This Creek Confederacy had grown to great numbers and was powerful enough to fight off any invasion or threat to their territory from the strong northern tribes&#x2014;the Catawba, Cherokee, Iroquois, and Shawnee, to name a few. They spoke a typical Muskogean language that was closely related to the Choctaw language, with many words identical in pronunciation. This rather common language was quickly learned by early white frontiersmen with whom the tribe traded.<br>During the American Revolution, the Creek Nation made an effort to maintain its neutrality, although the tribe had earlier allied with the English. In 1786, the Creek Nation declared war on the state of Georgia, and several attempts at negotiating a treaty had failed. At the time of Billy Powell&#x2019;s birth in the early 1800s, there was no peace between the Creeks and the white people to the north. Incidences of violence between the two enemies were relatively minor, but tensions remained high and those border whites closest to the Creek Nation were in constant fear of an attack. This was the state of the world into which Billy would be born and reared.1<br>The birth and lineage of Billy Powell has been a source of question and controversy over the years. Most historians agree that he was born in or near the town of Tallassee, Alabama&#x2014;northeast of modern-day Montgomery&#x2014;in the year 1804. The identities of both his parents and his ancestors, however, are a less settled matter.2<br>The most credible and widely accepted account of Billy&#x2019;s ancestry relies mainly on the reminiscences of Thomas S. Woodward, a contemporary white soldier and distinguished Creek historian. Woodward claimed that Billy&#x2019;s lineage could be traced back to James McQueen, a Scottish sailor who had jumped ship in Charleston in the late 1690s and in 1716 became the first white man to trade with the Creeks. McQueen remained with the Creeks as a trader from that day forth until, according to Woodward, he died at the remarkable age of 128 in the year 1811.<br>James McQueen, who was known among the Creek people as the Soft-Shelled Turtle, fathered many children during his lifetime. At some point, McQueen married a young Creek woman from Tallassee, who bore him a son, Peter McQueen, and a daughter named Ann. James McQueen&#x2019;s daughter Ann grew up to marry a white man or a man of mixed race named Jose Copinger. Ann Copinger then gave birth to a daughter named Polly, who married a white trader named William Powell. Billy Powell was said to have been born from this union between Polly and William Powell, thereby making him of mixed blood, with Scottish and Creek, or Muskogee, being the most prevalent that flowed through his veins.3<br>There are those interested parties and historians who dispute this accepted theory that Billy was of mixed blood&#x2014;including Billy himself. He was quoted by George Catlin, who painted his portrait in 1838, shortly before his death, as saying, &#x201c;No foreign blood runs in my veins; I am pure-blood Muskogee.&#x201d;4<br>This adamant denial has created a major contradiction, because this youngster who grew up to become Osceola has been called &#x201c;Billy Powell&#x201d; in countless references. There has been speculation ranging from the idea that Billy Powell was merely a nickname or that William Powell was not his real father but his stepfather to the idea that he could not have had white blood because the man Osceola did not speak English. Lieutenant L. L. Cohen, a contemporary and historian, wrote in 1836 that he believed that Billy&#x2019;s father was a full-blooded Creek who died after Billy was born&#x2014;Polly then married the trader William Powell. No evidence exists to confirm any of these theories.5<br>Cohen, however, must have known that the Creek family structure was matrilineal, with each person belonging to his or her mother&#x2019;s clan and with descent and inheritance evolving from that side. Young Billy, and later the man Osceola, would have accepted the fact that his mother was full-blooded Creek because her mother had been full-blooded Creek, which, to his way of thinking, would have made him a full-blooded Creek&#x2014;regardless of whether or not William Powell had been his biological father. Dr. John K. Mahon, a respected historian of Southeastern Native American traditions, wrote that &#x201c;among both the Creeks and the Seminoles a man was a member of his mother&#x2019;s clan, and home to him was where the mother of his clan lived.&#x201d;6<br>William Powell disappeared from Billy&#x2019;s life by about 1808, as best as can be determined, although he might have remained as late as 1814. In keeping with Creek tradition, however, William Powell would have had little or no influence through the years on his son. His mother and her male relatives&#x2014;in this case his well-known warrior grand-uncle, Peter McQueen&#x2014;would have been responsible for rearing the boy. Billy&#x2019;s upbringing by his mother&#x2019;s side of the family would also explain why he did not speak English. Peter McQueen, incidentally, although proved to be of mixed-blood ancestry, always claimed, perhaps on the basis of his own maternal lineage, that he, too, was a pure-blooded Creek.7<br>Billy&#x2019;s peo...</p><h2>Nana, Vol. 15 (15)</h2><p>R to L (Japanese Style)<br><br>Nana "Hachi" Komatsu hopes that moving to Tokyo will help her make a clean start and leave her capricious love life behind her.

By &#34;revolutionary interpretation&#34; Hook meant quite literally that Marx&#39;s main objective was to stimulate revolutionary opposition to class society.Hook later abandoned the revolutionary views expressed in this volume, but he never abandoned his warm positive views of Marx as a thinker and a fighter for freedom. He eventually concluded that 20th century history had proved both him and Marx wrong about the necessity of revolutionary means to achieve their mutual social goals. But, says his son Ernest B. Hook in an introduction, this concession of error &#34;he did not see . . . as an admission of intellectual weakness, but the natural position of a reasonable person when, in the light of observation and experience, he concludes he has erred.&#34;This expanded edition makes readily available for scholars an influential work long out of print and provides critical insight into the intellectual development of one of the 20th-century&#39;s great thinkers.</p><p><b>Sidney Hook</b> (1902-1989) was professor emeritus at New York University and a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

He was assistant editor at Punch Magazine and enjoyed great success with his novels, plays and stories. And of course he is best remembered for his children&#39;s novels and verses featuring Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin. This is both an account of how a writer was formed and a charming period piece on literary life - Milne met countless famous authors including H. G.

In 1902 he was Editor of Granta, the University magazine, and moved back to London the following year to enter journalism. By 1906 he was Assistant Editor of Punch, a post which he held until the beginning of the First World War when he joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. While in the army in 1917 he started on a career writing plays of which his best known are Mr. Pim Passes By, The Dover Road and an adaptation of Kenneth Grahame&#39;s The Wind in the Willows - Toad of Toad Hall. He married Dorothy de Selincourt in 1913 and in 1920 had a son, Christopher Robin. By 1924 Milne was a highly successful playwright, and published the first of his four books for children, a set of poems called When We Were Very Young, which he wrote for his son. This was followed by the storybook Winnie-the-Pooh in 1926, more poems in Now We Are Six (1927) and further stories in The House at Pooh Corner(1928). In addition to his now famous works, Milne wrote many novels, volumes of essays, a well known detective story The Red House Mystery and light verse, works which attracted great success at the time.

In 1910 she married the important Russian poet and theorist Nikolai Gumilyov. Shortly afterwards Akhmatova began publishing her own poetry; together with Gumilyov, she became a central figure in the Acmeist movement. Acmeism -- which had its parallels in the writings of T. E. Hulme in England and the development of Imagism -- stressed clarity and craft as antidotes to the overly loose style and vague language of late nineteenth century poetry in Russia. The Russian Revolution was to dramatically affect their lives. Although they had recently divorced, Akhmatova was was nevertheless stunned by the execution of her friend and former partner Gumilyev in 1921 by the Bolsheviks, who claimed that he had betrayed the Revolution. In large measure to drive her into silence, their son Lev Gumilyov was imprisoned in 1938, and he remained in prison and prison camps until the death of Stalin and the thaw in the Cold War made his release possible in 1956. Meanwhile, Akhmatova had a second marraige and then a third; her third husband, Nikolai Punin, was imprisoned in 1949 and thereafter died in 1953 in a Siberian prison camp. Her writing was banned, unofficially, from 1925 to 1940, and then was banned again after World War Two was concluded. Unlike many of her literary contemporaries, though, she never considered flight into exile. Persecuted by the Stalinist government, prevented from publishing, regarded as a dangerous enemy , but at the same time so popular on the basis of her early poetry that even Stalin would not risk attacking her directly, Akhmatova&#39;s life was hard. Her greatest poem, &#34;Requiem,&#34; recounts the suffering of the Russian people under Stalinism -- specifically, the tribulations of those women with whom Akhmatova stood in line outside the prison walls, women who like her waited patiently, but with a sense of great grief and powerlessness, for the chance to send a loaf of bread or a small message to their husbands, sons, lovers. It was not published in in Russia in its entirety until 1987, though the poem itself was begun about the time of her son&#39;s arrest. It was his arrest and imprisonment, and the later arrest of her husband Punin, that provided the occasion for the specific content of the poem, which is sequence of lyric poems about imprisonment and its affect on those whose loveed ones are arrested, sentenced, and incarcerated behing prison walls.. The poet was awarded and honorary doctorate by Oxford University in 1965. Akhmatova died in 1966 in Leningrad.Text: English, Russian (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Technical Drawing</h2><p><p><b></b> This book's practical, well illustrated, step-by-step explanations of procedures have successfully trained users for 60 years, and continue to appeal to today's visually oriented users. <b></b> This book offers the best coverage of basic graphics principles and an unmatched set of fully machinable working drawings. <b></b> For professions that utilize the skills of engineering graphics/technical drawing and drafting/technical sketching. </p></p><p>Technical Drawing is the authoritative text on drawing and graphics-- its complete coverage has successfully trained students for 60 years and still dominates the market. Technical Drawing has the best set of fully machinable working drawings--now updated to reflect current ANSI standards. The Tenth Edition has been redesigned to appeal to today&#39;s visually oriented students, but retains the practical step-by-step explanations of procedures and excellent problems that has made this book so successful in past editions.Preface <p> ABOUT THIS BOOK </p><p> Over the last sixty years, Technical Drawing has taught well over a million students the practices and techniques of graphical communication. Both instructors and their students have come to depend on this text as the authority on the subject, and most students have used this book as a professional reference long after they have finished taking this course. Why has this book been so successful? First, the main goal of the text has always been to explain each principle so clearly that the student is certain to understand it, and to make the text interesting enough to encourage all students to read and study on their own. Second, this book has also had what are unquestionably the best, most detailed, and accurate set of drawings on the market. A student skilled with this book's drawings will have a full repertoire of graphical skills in his or her hands. Lastly, Technical Drawing continually has sought to address the new technologies and the skills that constantly change this field. By doing so, this text prepares students to enter the marketplace and face the challenges of a rapidly changing playing field. </p><p> THE ELEVENTH EDITION </p><p> The Eleventh Edition of Technical Drawing continues to offer the best coverage of basic graphics principles available. Edition after edition, this text serves as the authoritative source on the subject. With this new version, we have acted upon the requests of over 30 reviewers to improve certain aspects of the book while preserving its core presentation. In particular, this new volume features: </p><p> Greatly increased coverage of the design process in Chapter 14. This chapter now includes coverage of 3D solid modeling, and parametric or constraint-based modeling. Thoroughly revised chapter on manufacturing processes. We especially thank Professor Serope Kalpakjian of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the author of Manufacturing Engineering and Technology for his assistance with this chapter. Over 50 brand new questions /problems. These problems feature parts that come from a variety of industries. Material on Instrumental Drawing and Lettering condensed to one chapter. New coverage of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing. Extensive updating of text graphics to comply to most recent ANSI standards. New "Graphics Spotlights" feature that highlights a particular use of graphics in industry. A decrease in the overall size of the book. Instructors have told us that students are finding books too large. However, they want their students to have access to important reference material. To achieve both these goals, we have eliminated the chapters on Graphs and Diagrams and Alignment Charts included in the last edition, and included them in Adobe pdf format on a free CD. This CD also contains over 30 animations of graphics concepts. Updated web site http-//prenhall /giesecke now includes even more questions for review, as well as a new feature available for January of 2000 that lets professors create their own on-line syllabus. Using a simple interface, instructors build a graphic assignment list and use it to interact with their class over the web. This site also features links to other graphics related areas, a selection of animations available for class instruction or student review, an exploration of VRML technology, a case studies exploring how graphics communication is handled at an engineering company, and more. This site will be a constant resource to help instructors and students remain as current as possible. Eight -Page Color Insert. To give students a feel for how color is often used in CAD software and other technological processes, but without overloading and obscuring the book's core content, we have included an eight-page color insert. </p><p> SUPPLEMENTS </p><p> INSTRUCTOR'S MANUAL WITH SOLUTIONS/RESOURCE CD </p><p> This new manual prepared by Tom Kane of Pueblo Community College includes outlines, teaching tips, extra quiz questions, and other tools designed to aid in class preparation.

The mercury pushes past ninety degrees even as the sun stuffs its hands in its pockets, turns its back, and walks away for another night. I feel the same way.</p><p>We&#x2019;re inside, though, momentarily away from the heat. Tan carpeting, blue wallpaper, white ceiling with track lighting. Six of us are in chairs, sitting in a circle, an obedient shape. We&#x2019;re quiet. We&#x2019;re trained. The hum of the central air conditioner is enough to keep us occupied while we wait for further instructions. No one wants to look at the other, or engage in conversation, not before the designated time. Normally, it&#x2019;s the kind of situation I wouldn&#x2019;t mind tweaking, but I&#x2019;m still exhausted and overheated from my walk over here. Besides, we&#x2019;ve all been tweaked enough.</p><p>This guy named Gus sits next to me. He&#x2019;s been coming here as long as I have. He&#x2019;s short and wiry, and he wears black hornrimmed glasses. He has thick beard stubble that has been cultivated and encouraged and colorful tattoos on his pale, thin arms. Behind one less-than-impressive bicep is the face of a green cartoon dog that winks and chomps on a cigarette. The dog has the right idea.</p><p>Gus is around my age, early-but-aging thirties, and like me he&#x2019;s dressed in vintage clothes: black leisure pants, black wingtips, a white, skin-tight V-neck T-shirt tucked in and underneath his unbuttoned powder blue guayabera, a canary yellow porkpie hat that struggles to hold down purposefully greasy tufts of black hair. He pulls off the look better than me. I look like I stumbled out of your grandfather&#x2019;s closet, mothballs and all.</p><p>Gus is done with his drawing, and it rests on his lap. He taps his pen on the metal chair, working out something in double time. I sneak a peek at his picture. He took up an entire page. His head and hat are detailed and accurate. His body is a cartoonish mess. Legs and arms are broken, twisted. His forearms, hands, shins, knees, and feet and other unidentifiable pieces of himself break off and fall away, toward the bottom of the page. It&#x2019;s a good picture.</p><p>Gus catches me looking and says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t judge me,&#x201c; but then he winks, just like his tattoo dog. That&#x2019;s supposed to be a joke. I don&#x2019;t find anything funny.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s my drawing:</p><p>It&#x2019;s a smaller, doodle version of my head. It&#x2019;s all anyone ever need see of me. Rembrandt, I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m not even that paint-the-happy-tree-there guy.</p><p>Gus leans in and gets an eyeful. I say, &#x201c;I did better when I tried drawing that turtle and the pirate for those art tests in the backs of magazines.&#x201d;</p><p>Doctor Who announces his return to the circle. &#x201c;Okay, everyone,&#x201c; he says, and that&#x2019;s it. It&#x2019;s enough for us to know what to do next. He hands out bonus smiles while collecting the pens and our composition notebooks, the kind I used in elementary school. My notebook has chunks of paper torn out. The black-and-white cover is warped and cracked. Our assignment was to draw a self-portrait, but we&#x2019;re not going to talk about it until next week. This is my sixth group therapy session at the Wellness Center, and I&#x2019;m feeling well-er every day.</p><p>If I sound skeptical, I don&#x2019;t mean to. I&#x2019;m just practical. My landlord and mother, Ellen, made my weekly visits to the center compulsory if I was to continue running my little private detective business rent free in her building. We&#x2019;re at a point where she thinks my narcolepsy is some kind of social disorder, not physical. It&#x2019;s all depressing enough to make me want to attend group therapy.</p><p>The doctor pulls a chair into our circle. He&#x2019;s not British or into science fiction, but he tolerates me calling him Dr. Who. He&#x2019;d tell you that my naming him is an attempt at asserting some control in my life. He&#x2019;d tell you that my everyday existence is usually about naming and piecing together my reality even if the pieces don&#x2019;t fit. I&#x2019;d tell you that I just like calling a tall, skinny, bald guy Dr. Who.</p><p>The doc, he&#x2019;s nice, plenty enthusiastic, and obviously means well&#x2014;the ultimate backhanded compliment. There&#x2019;ve been times when I wanted to tell him everything, tell him more than I know. But there are other times when I&#x2019;m ready to take a vow of silence, like now, as I look at his faded khaki pants with the belt cinched well above the Canadian border and his white too-tight polo shirt. That shouldn&#x2019;t bother me, but it does.</p><p>He swoops the drawings up and away. Now it&#x2019;s story time. Everyone is to spill their tales in a regimented, predetermined order. I think that&#x2019;s what I hate most about this whole setup. It&#x2019;s disrespectful to stories. Stories don&#x2019;t happen that way. There&#x2019;s no order, no beginning, middle, or end; no one simply gets a turn. Stories are messy, unpredictable, and usually cruel.</p><p>I try not to listen. I&#x2019;m not being selfish. It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t empathize, because I empathize too much, and I can&#x2019;t help them.</p><p>I say I try not to listen, but it doesn&#x2019;t work. The man across from me goes on about how his cats are trying to sabotage the fragile relationship he has with his third ex-wife. Or maybe I&#x2019;m asleep and dreaming it.</p><p>It&#x2019;s Gus&#x2019;s turn. He has a smile that&#x2019;s wholly inappropriate for the setting. I kind of like it. He talks about how his mother&#x2014;who died two years ago&#x2014;used to make her own saltwater taffy when he was a kid. He tells us that since her death, he craves social settings and has become a compulsive joiner. If you have a club or group or association, he&#x2019;ll join it. He pulls out a wallet full of membership IDs. He gives me two cards: one for the Libertarian Party and the other belonging to some anarchist group that&#x2019;s clearly fraudulent because anarchists don&#x2019;t make ID cards. He seems particularly proud of that one.</p><p>Dr. Who holds up his clutched hands, like he&#x2019;s arm wrestling himself, and says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always welcome in our group, Gus.&#x201d;</p><p>Gus tips his hat and sags in his chair, clearly at ease in the group setting, a junky getting his fix. Despite his earlier protest, I&#x2019;m judging him. I don&#x2019;t feel guilty. I never promised him anything.</p><p>Dr. Who asks, &#x201c;Mark, do you have anything to share with us today?&#x201d;</p><p>Last week he phrased the question differently: Do you feel up to joining our conversation this week? I answered with a rant concerning his poorly phrased question, about how it was domineering and patronizing and made me feel more damaged than I already was. It was a solid rant, an 8 out of 10. But I don&#x2019;t know how much of the rant I let loose. I woke up with my circle mates out of their chairs, standing, and staring at me like I was a frog pinned up for dissection.</p><p>Gus wiggles his fingers at me, a reverse hand wave, the international Let&#x2019;s have it sign.</p><p>All right. Let&#x2019;s have it.</p><p>Excerpted from No Sleep till Wonderland by Paul Tremblay.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Paul Tremblay.<br>Published in 2010 by Henry Holt and Company.<br>All rights reserved.

That&#x2019;s what my father used to say, as we&#x2019;d stand on the edge of the bayou, fishing poles in hand. &#x201c;Life is like the water in that stream, always rushing past, always moving, different moment to moment.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought this was his way of telling me to enjoy the stillness of those quiet moments we had together, shoulder to shoulder on the solid bank. But now, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what he meant at all. I think he was trying to warn me that life could change, just like that. That currents could shift, and suddenly I could be headed in a direction I never imagined.<br> <br>Well, the current has shifted, that&#x2019;s for sure, I think as I search my bedroom floor around open boxes and crumpled piles of newspaper.<br> <br>I call to Mom and my brother Micah. &#x201c;If anyone finds my keys or my red Converse shoe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;ll give you something, though I don&#x2019;t know what since I can&#x2019;t find anything. But it will be worth it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Across the room, my black Lab looks up with hopes that I&#x2019;m searching for his leash but then drops his head back down onto his dog bed as if I&#x2019;ve really let him down.<br> <br>&#x201c;When I get home,&#x201d; I say, as I pick up a sheet of bubble wrap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s Micah&#x2019;s voice but somewhat muffled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>There aren&#x2019;t a lot of places he could be, so I head toward the living-dining-kitchen combination in the tiny cottage that has become our new home, sort of.<br> <br>Mom peers over her laptop from her perch at the kitchen counter. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen them,&#x201d; she says. Then when she looks at me adds, &#x201c;Um AJ, darling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you aren&#x2019;t wearing that, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She has that wrinkle in the space between her eyesbrows, as if the world is coming apart due to my wardrobe choices.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with what I&#x2019;m wearing?&#x201d; I glance down and bite the inside of my lip to hide the subtle pleasure that Mom has noticed. My look today was supposed to be a statement.<br> <br>My brother rises up from beneath the kitchen sink with a wrench in his hand and looks at me, then grins. &#x201c;Looks good to me. Or she will if she finds that other shoe.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom frowns and then hops off the bar stool and grabs a potholder. She reaches into the oven and pulls out a pan of baked French toast&#x2014;my favorite breakfast. It&#x2019;s almost enough to make me feel guilty, except I know it&#x2019;s her attempt to make up for what happened last night.<br> <br>I glance down at my T-shirt that says &#x201c;Chuck &amp; Sons Auto Repair,&#x201d; my favorite jeans, one red Converse, and a gray sock on one foot. No one says it, but we all know the reason behind my clothing choice, or at least T-shirt choice.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just think, well, first impressions are important. This is a very nice school and it&#x2019;s a blessing you were admitted. And we aren&#x2019;t in Louisiana anymore,&#x201d; Mom says.<br> <br>Micah and I share an eye roll before he disappears back under the sink. I give Mom my widest fake smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m well aware we aren&#x2019;t in Louisiana. We&#x2019;re in the land of glitzy cowboy boots and perfect hair. I think my outfit will be a refreshing change.&#x201d;<br> <br>My brother chuckles and peers out from beneath the sink. &#x201c;Now, AJ. You can&#x2019;t go around talking like that. Who knows? Maybe you&#x2019;ll be the next country star now that we&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> <br>All right, I have to admit, that makes me laugh, even though I&#x2019;m not exactly in the mood. I am so not country star material.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot more to Nashville than that,&#x201d; Mom says. &#x201c;And there are more opportunities here than back home. I know it&#x2019;s a big change, but it&#x2019;s for the best&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Mom&#x2019;s voice drifts off, as if she&#x2019;s too tired to try convincing my brother and me.<br> <br>And she&#x2019;s got a lot of convincing to do, especially after the bomb she dropped last night. We had been here only a week and were just starting to get settled, when&#x2014;bam! just like that&#x2014;everything was changing again.<br> <br>Our video call with my other brother Noah, Micah&#x2019;s twin, had been going so well&#x2014;almost like old times&#x2014;even though Noah was just transferred to a military base in Germany. Noah was telling us about buying a pair of lederhosen and how his German friends had asked him to stop yodeling, since that was a Swiss thing, not Bavarian. Micah and I were telling Noah about the glitzy city people we&#x2019;d seen in downtown Nashville with their black glasses and designer jeans that even men wore so tight we called them painted jeans instead of skinny jeans. I noticed Mom getting all twitchy, and at first I brushed it off as her missing her son and being worried about the war zone he might be sent to. But her foot kept tapping, and she breathed in and out like someone about to dive underwater.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, are you okay?&#x201d; I asked. My brothers, one beside me and one on the laptop screen, turned their attention toward her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom begins sentences with &#x201c;um&#x201d; when she isn&#x2019;t sure of what she&#x2019;s about to say. Our laughter and joking died down pretty fast, and we waited. I almost chuckled at the serious expression on �Noah&#x2019;s face as he leaned closer to the screen from the other side of the world. Then I saw Mom looking as nervous as she did when she told us we were moving to Nashville, and all humor completely dissolved. What was she about to tell us? The last serious news had changed our lives forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d; Noah asked via video call.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, no, no, not at all. Nothing wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not a good sign.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Micah and AJ already met my friend, Charles Worthington.&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned to the laptop screen and leaned in. &#x201c;Remember, my friend I told you about? He and his son helped unload some of the boxes over the weekend, and Charles gave me a lot of advice before we moved up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His son was super annoying,&#x201d; I said with a laugh, hoping to lighten the moment. But Micah gave me an elbow to the ribs, and Mom&#x2019;s face showed she most certainly didn&#x2019;t agree.<br> <br>&#x201c;They helped us out, and we should be thankful,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked to Noah on the laptop screen for help and then blurted out as a joke, &#x201c;What, you aren&#x2019;t dating him, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom&#x2019;s face flushed to crimson. The boys and I didn&#x2019;t move.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little more than that. I know this will come as a shock, but we&#x2019;ve known each other since childhood. We were quite close until I went to college and married your father. A few months ago, he found me on Facebook when he heard I was moving back. All of it has been a shock to me, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A social media romance? Really?&#x201d; I heard myself say. Daddy would have told me to apologize for being disrespectful, but this wouldn&#x2019;t be going on if Dad were still here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, what is happening?&#x201d; Micah asked with a strong under�tone that helped Mom just blurt it out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Charles proposed. And I said yes, but we won&#x2019;t get married for a very long time, there&#x2019;s no rush, we have no plans yet. I still can&#x2019;t believe he asked me, or that I said yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our faces must have reflected all horror and no excitement whatsoever. That&#x2019;s how I felt, anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing is going to change, so none of you have to worry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing is going to change? Everything is&#x2014;&#x201d; I said, but Micah interrupted me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this for real?&#x201d; Micah looked as confused as I felt.<br> <br>&#x201c;AJ. Micah,&#x201d; Noah said from the rectangular screen on the counter. His steady expression was a new one, probably honed from boot camp and a year as a soldier. &#x201c;This is where we say congratulations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But, but&#x2014;Daddy hasn&#x2019;t been gone even two years,&#x201d; I said. Someone had to say it.<br> <br>I hoped one of my brothers would back me up. I knew they&#x2019;d hatched a plan to take care of Mom and me with Daddy gone. They were twin brothers who&#x2019;d never been apart. They always planned to join the Marines after two years of college, when they could go in as officers. They planned to finish getting their degrees after their service.<br> <br>Then after Dad, my brothers came up with a different plan. Micah stayed working at Daddy&#x2019;s old auto shop, even after the new owners took over, while Noah enlisted early and sent money home every month. College was no longer mentioned.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know how long he&#x2019;s been gone,&#x201d; Mom said in a whisper. &#x201c;I know every day that he&#x2019;s been gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our video call ended very soon after that. What more could be said? Just like that, Mom was ending everything. Life as we knew it was going to change, again.<br> <br>Now I watch Mom dish up thick squares of doughy baked French toast as the room fills with the scent of cinnamon and baking bread. My stomach growls. Mom has always been pretty; everyone says so. Her light hair and stunning blue eyes weren&#x2019;t passed on to me. I have Dad&#x2019;s chestnut hair and dark hazel eyes. In so many ways, I&#x2019;m nothing like her.<br> <br>I love my mom, but I don&#x2019;t understand her. With Daddy, everything was easy. We had the same sense of humor&#x2014;we&#x2019;d laugh at most everything&#x2014;and I knew his moods without having to ask or wonder. It hasn&#x2019;t been like that with Mom, and the idea of her marrying Charles makes the least sense of anything she&#x2019;s ever done.<br> <br>Charles is nothing like my father. Besides, any man who goes by the name of Charles, instead of Charlie or Chuck like Daddy, just isn&#x2019;t someone to know, let alone marry. For that matter, how could Mom marry anyone with the same name as Dad? Charles works in an air-�conditioned office and drives a luxury car; his hands look as if they&#x2019;ve never seen a callus or blister in his life.<br> <br>Dad&#x2019;s hands were rough with scars and calluses and stained from auto grease. Dad worked hard every day, yet always took time for the little things. He loved a good sunrise just a tad more than sunset. On road trips, we&#x2019;d play a game where we&#x2019;d try naming an engine size by the sound it made. And when we went out for peaches-and-cream snow cones, he savored each bite like a man enjoying his last meal. I&#x2019;m still convinced he had the best bedtime story voice of any father who ever lived&#x2014;even friends who stayed overnight agreed.<br> <br>So this morning I put on one of the T-shirts Dad ordered for his shop that says Chuck &amp; Sons Auto Repair. Wearing it makes him feel close again and shows where my allegiance remains.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, looking for these?&#x201d; Micah says after moving his toolbox off the counter. &#x201c;And didn&#x2019;t you say you&#x2019;d give something to the person who finds them?&#x201d;<br> <br>He holds up a set of keys and tosses them to me. I catch them easily and rub my thumb and index finger over the lucky silver dollar coin. The coin belonged to my grandfather, then passed to my father, then to Noah, who made it into a key chain. When Noah left for the military, he made me the caretaker of his beloved Jeep and the lucky key chain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep, I owe you, something great. Soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t sound very promising,&#x201d; Micah says.<br> <br>I catch Mom glance at my shirt again. Her expression says she&#x2019;s seeing something she wants to forget.<br> <br>Dad promised that when I turned eighteen, he&#x2019;d add &#x201c;Daughter&#x201d; to the shop name if I promised to do the great things he was sure God had planned for me. As a child, I&#x2019;d cry if anyone said a girl couldn&#x2019;t work in Daddy&#x2019;s auto shop. He called me his little grease monkey, and Mom was constantly upset at the dirt and oil on my pink frilly outfits. But in junior high, school and church activities filled my evenings and weekends, and I didn&#x2019;t have as much time to hand Dad tools or lean under a hood to study the twist of hoses and parts that wove an engine together. I just assumed no matter what I did or where I went, someday that name would be there: Chuck, Sons &amp; Daughter Auto Repair.<br> <br>I thought we had forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to start school today,&#x201d; Mom says and sets two steaming plates on the counter for Micah and me. She gets some plastic flatware from the counter, since we haven&#x2019;t found some boxes quite yet. &#x201c;You can start on Monday instead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m a little concerned I&#x2019;m getting behind,&#x201d; I say as I move toward the gooey breakfast.<br> <br>My brother shakes his head to keep from laughing. School is the worst excuse I&#x2019;ve ever used, but after Mom tried to salvage last night with cheerful stories about how Charles promised to come over today to help unpack boxes and hook up our washer and dryer&#x2014;though my brother is perfectly capable and most certainly more experienced with a set of tools&#x2014;I knew I needed to get out of the house. That&#x2019;s when it became essential that I start school ASAP.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very responsible of you,&#x201d; Mom says. She&#x2019;s trying to sound cheerful, but not succeeding. She pulls a jar of syrup out of a simmering pot on the stove and sets it down with the pot holder by our plates. Now I feel more stabs of guilt, but not enough to make me spend the day with Mom and Charles.<br> <br>I gobble down the French toast, good as it is, but with starting a new school, I need to get going. I need to get my class schedule and figure out where everything is before the campus is packed with tons of people all staring at the new girl. I&#x2019;ve never been the new girl before.<br> <br>I do another quick search through the house and find my missing Converse between Mom&#x2019;s art and history books, which are stacked precariously on the floor. A sense of being adrift washes over me. Mom would be leaving me in a different way than Daddy did. But she&#x2019;d be leaving me all the same. My brothers are twins, so they have each other for life. I&#x2019;m the one who seems lost, the misfit. And soon I won&#x2019;t have a home at all. Charles&#x2019;s house will never be home to me.<br> <br>Would Dad be sad knowing the girl he loved since their freshman year of college was marrying someone else so quickly? Would he feel sad that we sold his auto shop and moved to Tennessee, and all that was left were the T-shirts he bought us just months before he died?<br> <br>No matter where we live or what we do, I can&#x2019;t leave Daddy behind. I&#x2019;ll wear his shirt every day if that&#x2019;s what I need to do to show Mom, Charles, or anyone else that Daddy is with us always.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bye, Buck-boy. We&#x2019;ll walk tonight,&#x201d; I say, bending down to give my dog a good rub on the back that gets his tail wagging.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can come with you to meet your counselor. Charles isn&#x2019;t coming for a while,&#x201d; Mom says as I enter the kitchen on my way to the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Having my mom walk around with me, as a junior in high school&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now that might make a bad first impression,&#x201d; I say with a smile. She nods and chuckles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, no dents in Noah&#x2019;s baby,&#x201d; my brother says as he dishes up another helping of French toast.<br> <br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t you break any cars,&#x201d; I say, tossing back a line Dad used whenever he left the guys at his auto shop.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you know about it? Have fun at your fancy-schmancy school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before I walk out the door, I go back and give Mom a quick hug. She clings a few seconds and grasps the back of my shirt like a life raft, and then breaks away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you, Sweetie. I will pray you have a good first day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom, and thanks for the French toast. It was really good.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cold morning makes me shiver as I crunch across the frozen ground toward Noah&#x2019;s black Jeep. I&#x2019;m starting a new school in a new state in the middle of my junior year. It is also a Wednesday&#x2014;who starts a new high school on a Wednesday in February?<br> <br>I&#x2019;m usually as optimistic about life and tough times as Daddy was. He never seemed moved by adversity. So as I drive down the cold country road toward town, I conjure up some hope that today will be just fine and that somewhere there&#x2019;s an end to this displaced feeling. But despite my little mental pep talk, I can&#x2019;t help won...</p><h2>The American Health Care Paradox: Why Spending More is Getting Us Less</h2><p><b>Foreword by Harvey V. Fineberg, President of the Institute of Medicine</b><br><br>For decades, experts have puzzled over why the US spends more on health care but suffers poorer outcomes than other industrialized nations. Now Elizabeth H. Bradley and Lauren A. Taylor marshal extensive research, including a comparative study of health care data from thirty countries, and get to the root of this paradox: We've left out of our tally the most impactful expenditures countries make to improve the health of their populations investments in social services. <br><br>In <i>The American Health Care Paradox</i>, Bradley and Taylor illuminate how narrow definitions of health care,&#x201d; archaic divisions in the distribution of health and social services, and our allergy to government programs combine to create needless suffering in individual lives, even as health care spending continues to soar. They show us how and why the US health care system&#x201d; developed as it did; examine the constraints on, and possibilities for, reform; and profile inspiring new initiatives from around the world. <br><br>Offering a unique and clarifying perspective on the problems the Affordable Care Act won't solve, this book also points a new way forward. <br></p><p><b>Elizabeth H. Bradley</b> is professor of public health at Yale University, faculty director of its Global Health Leadership Institute, and master at Branford College. The recipient of a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation grant, she was previously director of the health management program and co-director of the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program at Yale and served as hospital administrator at Massachusetts General Hospital. She lives in New Haven, Connecticut.<br><br><b>Lauren A. Taylor</b> studies public health and medical ethics at Harvard Divinity School, where she is a presidential scholar. She was formerly a program manager at the Yale Global Health Leadership Institute, where she led a research team in building a model for scaling up public health innovations for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. She completed a master's in public health at Yale University in 2009. She lives in Boston, Massachusetts. <br><br><br>Americans do not like being mediocre in national health outcomes but like even less facing the complex web of social conditions that produce and reinforce those uninspiring health outcomes. In short, Americans pay top dollar for hospitals, physicians, medications, and diagnostic testing but skimp in broad areas that are central to health such as housing, clean water, safe food, education, and other social services. It may even be that Americans spend large sums in health care to compensate for what they do not fund in social care and the tradeoff is not good for the country&#x2019;s health....<br><br>Physicians, many of whom see almost 30 patients per day, are increasingly aware that unmet social needs are essential contributors to worse health for Americans, and that they generate substantial costs within the medical system. In a recent national survey of 1,000 primary care physicians by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, eighty-five percent agreed that patients&#x2019; unmet social needs lead directly to worse health and that those needs are as important to address as patients&#x2019; medical conditions.<br><br>Physicians further reported that if they had the power to write prescriptions to address social needs, these prescriptions would represent one of every seven they write. Top social needs were noted as fitness (by 75% of respondents), nutritious food (by 64% of respondents), employment assistance (52% of respondents), education (49% of respondents), and housing (43% of respondents).<br><br>Among physicians we interviewed, many expressed frustration that medical tools do not address the most important drivers of poor health. One chief of emergency medicine summarized his work: We bandage them and send them out, but what they do out there is a black box. Who knows what happens then?&#x201d;</p><h2>Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest</h2><p><p>A classic account of exploration and endurance from the bestselling author of <i>The Wayfinders</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this magisterial work of history and adventure, based on more than a decade of prodigious research in British, Canadian and European archives, and months in the field in Nepal and Tibet, Wade Davis vividly re-creates British climbers' epic attempts to scale Mount Everest in the early 1920s. With new access to letters and diaries, Davis recounts the heroic efforts of George Mallory and his fellow climbers to conquer the mountain in the face of treacherous terrain and furious weather. He takes us beyond the Himalayas to the trenches of World War I, where Mallory and his generation found themselves and their world utterly shattered. In the wake of the war that destroyed all notions of honor and decency, the Everest expeditions, led by these scions of Britain's elite, emerged as a symbol of national redemption and hope.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Into the Silence </i>is a timeless portrait of an extraordinary generation of adventurers, the likes of which we will never see again.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011</strong>: It&#x2019;s tempting to call Wade Davis&#x2019;s magnificent <em>Into the Silence</em> an Everest of a book. But that would be misleading. It is more like K2: challenging, technically complex, and hugely rewarding upon completion. The book starts off not with mountaineering, but with vivid, novelistic descriptions of the horrors of the First World War. Years of waste and destruction in the trenches, Davis argues, &#x201c;led a desperate nation to embrace the assault on Everest as a gesture of imperial redemption.&#x201d; Those who endured attempts on the summit all bore the scars of the Great War&#x2014;and they were drawn to the mountain by an almost contradictory desire for conquest and spiritual ablution. At the center of it all is Mallory, whose eventual disappearance effectively closed that chapter in mountaineering. His utterance &#x201c;because it&#x2019;s there&#x201d; became a new war cry, but he climbed for deeper reasons entirely. <em>-- Chris Schluep</em>WADE DAVIS is the bestselling author of several books, including <i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i> and <i>One River</i>, and is an award-winning anthropologist, ethnobotanist, filmmaker and photographer.

A GAME OF THRONES is the first volume in the series. Summers span decades. Winter can last a lifetime. And the struggle for the Iron Throne has begun. It will stretch from the south, where heat breeds plot, lust and intrigues; to the vast frozen north, where a 700-foot wall of ice protects the kingdom from the dark forces that lie beyond. As Warden of the North, Lord Eddard Stark counts it a curse when King Robert bestows on him the office of the Hand. His honour weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will, not what he must...and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty. The old gods have no power in the south, Stark&#39;s family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, a vengeance-mad boy has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities beyond the sea. Heir of the mad Dragon King deposed by Robert, he claims the Iron Throne. In the game of thrones, you win or you die.</p><p>Readers of epic fantasy series are: (1) patient--they are left in suspense between each volume, (2) persistent--they reread or at least review the previous book(s) when a new installment comes out, (3) strong--these 700-page doorstoppers are <i>heavy</i>, and (4) mentally agile--they follow a host of characters through a myriad of subplots. In <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the first book of a projected six, George R.R. Martin rewards readers with a vividly real world, well-drawn characters, complex but coherent plotting, and beautifully constructed prose, which <i>Locus</i> called "well above the norms of the genre." <p> Martin's Seven Kingdoms resemble England during the Wars of the Roses, with the Stark and Lannister families standing in for the Yorks and Lancasters. The story of these two families and their struggle to control the Iron Throne dominates the foreground; in the background is a huge, ancient wall marking the northern border, beyond which barbarians, ice vampires, and direwolves menace the south as years-long winter advances. Abroad, a dragon princess lives among horse nomads and dreams of fiery reconquest.</p><p> There is much bloodshed, cruelty, and death, but <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is nevertheless compelling; it garnered a Nebula nomination and won the 1996 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. So, on to <i>A Clash of Kings</i>! <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Long ago, in a time long forgotten, a mysterious event threw the seasons of the world out of balance. Now the kingdom is blessed by golden summers that go on for years, and cursed by cruel winters that can last a generation. In the cool north of this kingdom is a castle, and a royal family ruled by Eddard Stark.<p></p><p>"For as Ned Stark's kingdom is assailed from the south by the poisonous plots of the rival house of the Lannisters, an even greater danger threatens his northern border: the un-earthly demons of legend, the Neverborn. And across the sea, the barbarian hordes are amassing. Dark times undoubtedly lie ahead. . . ."</p><p></p><p>So unfolds an unforgettable novel that will mark the launch of one of the greatest fantasy trilogies to appear in years. With all the adventure of Terry Brooks, all the magic of David Eddings, and the epic scope of Robert Jordan--and the literary aspirations of the granddaddy of them all, J. R. R. Tolkien--George R. R. Martin is about to enter the ranks of the elite handful of bestselling fantasy writers. <i>A Game Of Thrones</i> is a tale of unrivaled passion, heroism, action and romance, sure to win legions of fans.</p></p><h2>500 Tables: Inspiring Interpretations of Function and Style (500 Series)</h2><p><p>These 500 tables are more than just practical places to set a coffee cup or notepad; they&#x2019;re inspired works of art.

While continuing to explore the classic themes of horror and fantasy, successive generations of writers&#x2014;including Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Charles Beaumont, Stephen King, Steven Millhauser, and Thomas Ligotti&#x2014;have opened up the field to new subjects, new styles, and daringly fresh expansions of the genre&#x2019;s emotional and philosophical underpinnings. For many of these writers, the fantastic is simply the best available tool for describing the dislocations and newly hatched terrors of the modern era, from the nightmarish post-apocalyptic savagery of Harlan Ellison&#x2019;s &#x201c;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&#x201d; to proliferating identities set deliriously adrift in Tim Powers&#x2019; &#x201c;Pat Moore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At its core,&#x201d; writes editor Peter Straub, &#x201c;the fantastic is a way of seeing.&#x201d; In place of gothic trappings, the post-war masters of the fantastic often substitute an air of apparent normality. The surfaces of American life&#x2014;department store displays in John Collier&#x2019;s &#x201c;Evening Primrose,&#x201d; tar-paper roofs seen from an el train in Fritz Leiber&#x2019;s &#x201c;Smoke Ghost,&#x201d; the balcony of a dilapidated movie theater in Tennessee Williams&#x2019; &#x201c;The Mysteries of the Joy Rio&#x201d;&#x2014;become invested with haunting presences. The sphere of family life is transformed, in Davis Grubb&#x2019;s &#x201c;Where the Woodbine Twineth&#x201d; or Richard Matheson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Prey,&#x201d; into an arena of eerie menace. Dramas of madness, malevolent temptation, and vampiristic appropriation play themselves out against the backdrop of modern urban life in John Cheever&#x2019;s &#x201c;Torch Song&#x201d; and Shirley Jackson&#x2019;s unforgettable &#x201c;The Daemon Lover.&#x201d;<br><br>Nearly half the stories collected in this volume were published in the last two decades, including work by Michael Chabon, M. Rickert, Brian Evenson, Kelly Link, and Benjamin Percy: writers for whom traditional genre boundaries have ceased to exist, and who have brought the fantastic into the mainstream of contemporary writing.<br><br>The forty-two stories in this second volume of&nbsp;<i>American Fantastic Tales</i>&nbsp;provide an irresistible journey into the phantasmagoric underside of the American imagination.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

A past president of the Horror Writers of America and multiple award winner, he lives in New York City.Starred Review. In this second installment, Straub ventures onto somewhat more adventurous ground. His selections bring readers completely up to date with the genre, featuring tales from even the newest writers, such as M. Rickert and Joe Hill. This thorough anthology is likely to replace Fraser and Wise&#39;s 1944 Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural as a lib. It foreshadows the careers of writers who may very well turn out to be classics. Straub&#39;s reach is admirably broad, bringing to light worthy but under the radar talents such as Jane Rice and Jack Snow, both pulp writers who flourished briefly at the beginning of the &#34;modern&#34; era. Yet, he leaves room for the more mainstream writers: Jerome Bixby, Donald Wandrei, Fritz Leiber, Richard Matheson, and Poppy Z. Brite alongside Shirley Jackson, Paul Bowles, Joy Carol Oates, and Truman Capote. Straub incorporates such writers with originality: choosing, for example, to use Tennessee Williams&#39; &#34;The Mysteries of the Joy Rio&#34; for once rather than his more common &#34;The Vengeance of Nitocris.&#34; The anthology has genuinely imaginative writing and editorial vision.</p><h2>Kon-Tiki</h2><p><b>Now a major motion picture, <i>Kon-Tiki</i> is the record of Thor Heyerdahl&#x2019;s astonishing three-month voyage across the Pacific.</b><br><br><i>Kon-Tiki</i> is the record of an astonishing adventure across the Pacific Ocean.

I hadn&#x2019;t gone there since I started Weight Watchers a year ago because I had to lose weight; my doctor made me go. I could have switched doctors, but who needs it with all the forms you have to fill out if you switch. You just wish there were a central headquarters with all your information that you write out once so that everyone who needs anything could tap into it. <br><br>Weight Watchers is a good organization, I mean it does actually work if you do the program and they try really hard to make you like you, which, as you may know, is a problem a lot of fat people have, they have low self-esteem. Skinny people look at fat people with disgust and have visions of them stretched out on fuchsia-colored silk sofas snarfing down Cool Ranch Doritos and Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Chunky Monkey, but it isn&#x2019;t like that. What it is, is eating and eating with your shoulders hunched and your head down to scratch that itch that won&#x2019;t get scratched, and you have so much shame when you gobble things down you hardly even taste them. You start with I want and you end with I want, only now you have even more weight added to what is already too much and don&#x2019;t think we don&#x2019;t know it all, all, all the time. <br><br>But anyway, I went to my Weight Watchers meeting one day, and in addition to the usual annoying emaciated people who have no business there, there were two new members who absolutely blew my mind. Both of them on this same day. One was an old woman on oxygen with a walker taking about a thousand hours to get to the scales, and she was not to my eye fat at all. The other was a blind woman. Here is my question: When that blind woman looks into her mirror, what does she see? And anyway, she, too, had no visible blubber. I mean, I just walked out. I said to myself, No. Today, on account of those two women, on behalf of those two women, I am going to eat anything I want from now until midnight. And I drove right over to Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts. You may be thinking, Why did she go to Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts if she could have anything she wanted? Why didn&#x2019;t she go to Cinnabon? Well, because I actually like Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts way more than Cinnabon. Cinnabon is just a whore, you know, no subtlety. I like almost all the donuts at Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts and I really like the coffee though I usually just get regular coffee, milk, no sugar. But today I got coffee, heavy cream. &#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; the counter person asked. She was Hispanic, about thirty years old, beautiful long black hair tied back in a ponytail under her Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts hat and a really big caboose, what can you do, you&#x2019;d have to be a weird person not to gain a lot of weight if you worked at D.D. Once when I was on a road trip I stopped at this great country kitchen place and every single person who worked there was really fat, I mean really fat. With good skin. And it was a happy place; everybody seemed to get along really well, they were just smiling, holding their little pads and pencils and I had one of those why don&#x2019;t I move here moments, like where I saw myself sitting in a chair by a window in my little yellow house, lilac trees outside and nothing hurting inside. Like, content at last, which I always think I&#x2019;ll be if I move, but which I know is a wrong assumption even though a lot of us have it, just ask any real estate agent. But anyway, the counter woman (her name tag said sigrid, but I think maybe she just borrowed that name tag, it was put on with no care at all, for one thing, just hanging there perpendicularly). Anyway, Sigrid&#x2019;s fat looked good, truly, every now and then you see a person who wears fat well, it is that tight fat and just really looks kind of delicious and also their attitude is just great, like in your face: I&#x2019;m fat, so fucking what, get over your sanctimonious self. It&#x2019;s usually the tight fat people who are like that, maybe it&#x2019;s a gene. Anyway, after Sigrid said, &#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Oh yes, I want some donuts.&#x201d; I cannot tell you how swell that felt. <br><br>&#x201c;How many donuts?&#x201d; Sigrid asked and I said I didn&#x2019;t know, I would know when the little voice stopped. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; she said, and I said, &#x201c;Just get a big box, please, but maybe we won&#x2019;t quite fill it.&#x201d; So she got out a big Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts box and I just started salivating, like that experiment dog. Sigrid grabbed one of those tissue squares that I think we all take pleasure in using, and she raised her eyebrows and I said, &#x201c;Okay. A bow tie, a chocolate-frosted cake, a Key lime, a powdered cake, a Boston Kreme, a lemon bark, a maple-frosted, a coffee roll, a maple-frosted coffee roll, a cranberry muffin, a bagel and cream cheese and butter, too, on the bagel, and a plain Dunkin&#x2019; donut.&#x201d; And then before she tallied it up I handed her a fifty and said just keep the change and walked out. My back was feeling kind of hypervisible, like I was walking away really cool from a crime scene where I&#x2019;d been the criminal. My heart was racing and my mood level had shot way, way up. <br><br>I got in my car and I opened the coffee and had a deep whiff and a taste. Actually, I guess I have begun to prefer milk in my coffee because the cream tasted whoa. Next I opened the lid on the box and had a good whiff of the donuts. And then I looked around and there was no one so I ran my tongue along every single surface of every single donut. Man. It was sexual in a way, but more yeasty and better. Then I sucked the filling out of the Boston Kreme mixed with a little chocolate frosting. I dipped the powdered cake in the coffee and had one bite; ditto the chocolate-frosted. I went on in this manner until I would say about a third of the donuts were gone. And then I am sorry to say I threw the rest away. I would like to say I ate tidily and cut off where bite marks were and gave the rest to a homeless person along with a couple of finskis, but I did not. I threw them in the garbage, where maybe later they were found by a homeless person anyway or at least by pigeons, who, depending on where they live, can actually have it pretty good. Though sudden violent death is always a problem for them. But probably they have no attachments, which helps. <br><br>I was pretty full, so I went for a walk in a park to make room for lunch. It was a nice day and there were joggers, with their determined, miserable faces, and lovers lying in the grass thinking it would last forever. There were lots of dogs and one was a bulldog puppy, which, please, has cornered the market on cuteness. The owner was this very thin woman who looked sort of bitchy, which, think about it, most very thin women do&#x2014;even when they smile, it&#x2019;s like grimacing. Fat people are often miserable, too, but at least they look jolly even though it&#x2019;s really mostly them apologizing, like, &#x201c;Sorry, sorry, sorry I&#x2019;m taking up so much room,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m offending your idea of bodily aesthetics,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m clogging my arteries and giving the thumbs-up to diabetes.&#x201d; And spilling over airline seats, which, come on, even for skinny people those seats are ridiculous. Metal girdles. <br><br>Lunch was a problem, like do I sit down or continue to fast-food it. Because I really do appreciate good food, but fast food is what I always want. Drive past a White Castle? See myself opening one of the little burgers with the onions all square. Go past KFC? See the big bucket, lift off the lid, see the one corner of one breast just loaded with coating that you pull off and pop into your mouth. Wendy&#x2019;s? Regular with cheese, just a plain regular with cheese and it is good. The buns are still good at Wendy&#x2019;s, they&#x2019;re not those weary things other places give you that are like bread out of an old person&#x2019;s bread box who never throws anything away and it was cheap bread and not good in the first place. Generic. <br><br>Hot dogs? Well. I live in Chicago, where we know what hot dogs are and how they should be served. I know someone who used to fly from Boston to San Francisco once a month on business and she always stopped in Chicago so she could get a red hot. She said she told people she needed a walk but really she needed a red hot. She ate them in the first-class cabin and all the people used to get pissed off at her. She said they got pissed off because the onions stunk the place up, but I think they got pissed off because they didn&#x2019;t have the foresight to bring a red hot on board themselves. A flight attendant can put all the French words in the world after &#x201c;beef&#x201d; and it still tastes like airline food, which tastes like jet fuel smells. <br><br>They don&#x2019;t have red hots in the airport all over the place like they used to. If you come to O&#x2019;Hare and you have a bit of a layover, get in a cab and tell them Superdawg at Milwaukee and Nagle, it&#x2019;s only about ten minutes away. Get the regular hot dog, but you might also want to try the Whoopercheesie or Whoopskidawg. There is only one Superdawg and it was started by a guy and his wife, they fell in love in high school and now they&#x2019;re probably in their eighties. You can see her working the booth, she sits there in her black nylon windbreaker and you shout your order into the little metal box by where you park. Everybody gets their own speaker and their own menu, which has humorous descriptions of the food. <br><br>Portillo&#x2019;s hot dogs are also good, and their tamales, oh my. You eat them with a plastic spoon, which adds to the flavor, as does the light orange grease stain on the wrapper. But the Portillo&#x2019;s are not as close to the airport, you might not have time. Although if you said to anyone who knew Chicago, &#x201c;I missed my flight because I had to go to Portillo&#x2019;s,&#x201d; they would say, &#x201c;Oh, I know, did you get a tamale?&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re debating, which should I go to?, pick Superdawg, because they are not a chain. Always pick the thing that...</p><h2>Fire Truck to the Rescue! (LEGO City, Scholastic Reader: Level 1)</h2><p>Explore the LEGO City.<br><br>There's a fire in LEGO City.

Ann Zwinger's is that of a naturalist, an "observer at the river's brim."<br><br> Teamed with scientists and other volunteer naturalists, Zwinger was part of an ongoing study of change along the Colorado. In all seasons and all weathers, in almost every kind of craft that goes down the waves, she returned to the Grand Canyon again and again to explore, look, and listen.&nbsp;From the thrill of running the rapids to the wonder in a grain of sand, her words take the reader down 280 miles of the "ever-flowing, energetic, whooping and hollering, galloping" river.<br><br> Zwinger's book begins with a bald eagle count at Nankoweap Creek in January and ends with a subzero, snowy walk out of the canyon at winter solstice. Between are the delights of spring in side canyons, the benediction of rain on a summer beach, and the chill that comes off limestone walls in November.<br><br> Her eye for detail catches the enchantment of small things played against the immensity of the river: the gatling-gun love song of tree frogs; the fragile beauty of an evening primrose; ravens "always in close attendance, like lugubrious, sharp-eyed, nineteenth-century undertakers"; and a golden eagle chasing a trout "with wings akimbo like a cleaning lady after a cockroach."<br><br> As she travels downstream, Zwinger follows others in history who have risked&#x2014;and occasionally lost&#x2014;their lives on the Colorado. Hiking in narrow canyons, she finds cliff dwellings and broken pottery of prehistoric Indians. Rounding a bend or running a rapid, she remembers the triumphs and tragedies of early explorers and pioneers. She describes the changes that have come with putting a big dam on a big river and how the dam has affected the riverine flora and fauna as well as the rapids and their future.<br><br> Science in the hands of a poet, this captivating book is for armchair travelers who may never see the grandiose Colorado and for those who have run it wisely and well. Like the author, readers will find themselves bewitched by the color and flow of the river, and enticed by what's around the next bend. With her, they will find its rhythms still in the mind, long after the splash and spray and pound are gone.</p><p>This captivating book is for armchair travelers who may never see the grandiose Colorado River in the Grand Canyon and for those who have run it wisely and well.

He had happened upon a puddle of ointment, and knew there would be flies in it. He was just about to nab a fat fly, taking care not to get stuck in the slimy stuff himself&#x2014;whereupon a hook swung down from the sky and caught him by the scruff of his chitin. It hauled him up, up, and away, dizzyingly.<br>Then it dropped him into another scene. This was strange beyond his experience. The ointment was gone, and with it the delectable fly. The plants were thick-stemmed and woody, reaching into the sky, sheathed in clusters of green leaves. Some were small green blades hugging the ground. There was a bird, but no threat to him because it was so small as to be no bigger than a mite. Weird!<br>Jumper suffered a tweak of memory. His great-to- the-nth grandfather, the original Jumper, had had experience with such a realm. Where was it?<br>There was a scream. Jumper reacted before he thought, getting there in a single bound. Jumping was of course his nature; he could cover many times his body length per jump, and make a perfect landing. He was, after all, a free- ranging spider.<br>It was&#x2014;his distant tenth-hand memory tweaked&#x2014;a man, grabbing a girl. Girls needed protecting. So he extended a foreleg, caught the man by the scruff, heaved him up, and threw him away. The man landed in a prickle bush, yelped, looked at Jumper, yelped again, and fled.<br>&#x201c;Xx, xxxxx xxx!&#x201d; the girl cried, getting to her two thick feet.<br>Jumper clicked his mandibles in confusion. He did not speak girl talk. He was trying to figure out what a girl was doing in this scene. Girls were properly of the giant realm.<br>She gazed at him, then went to the side and fetched something squirmy. She brought it to him. She held it up with one of her forelegs.<br>Jumper reached out a foreleg and took it. It seemed to be a writhing nest of greenish leaves. What was he supposed to do with it?<br>The girl made a gesture as of putting something in her mouth part. Oh&#x2014;this was edible? He lifted it to his own mouth, to taste it. But the thing immediately squirmed into his mouth and filled it with twisting strands.<br>&#x201c;Oh, thank yew!&#x201d; the girl exclaimed, exactly as before.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Jumper said.<br>Then he paused, astonished. Not only had he understood her, he had replied in her own language. How could that be?<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the tongues,&#x201d; the girl said. &#x201c;I gave yew the gift of tongues. So we could talk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tongues?&#x201d; he asked, perplexed. There was something funny about the way she talked, without any clicking of mandibles; could this explain it?<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a kind of plant,&#x201d; she clarified. &#x201c;It enables a person to relate to any language. Yew saved me from getting abused by that village lout, and I wanted to thank yew. So I had to enable yew to talk. Yew can spit out the tongues now, if yew want.&#x201d;<br>He considered that. &#x201c;First, can you tell me where this is? I am not familiar with this scene.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, yew woodn&#x2019;t be. Yew&#x2019;re a spider, aren&#x2019;t yew? A big one. Yew must bee from far away. This is Xanth proper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Xanth proper! That&#x2019;s where my ancestor was.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I dew knot know about him, but yew came in on a narrative hook. I saw it drop yew here. I was so surprised that I was knot careful, and that lout caught me. Then yew rescued me. I really dew appreciate that. Most creatures woodn&#x2019;t have bothered.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A narrative hook?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a device to catch someone up in a story right away. Once it hooks yew, yew can&#x2019;t leave the scene.&#x201d;<br>Jumper wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with that, so he changed the subject. &#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t someone else have bothered to help you? You seem like a nice girl, for your species.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My species. There&#x2019;s the rub. Yew see, I&#x2019;m knot really a girl.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not? You look like one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From the front.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You seem to have a nice front.&#x201d; She was bare, and shapely. He was remembering the descriptions handed down to the descendants by the original Jumper. Girls were supposed to have thin forelegs, thick hind legs, and fleshy cones on their torsos. She did.<br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m really a woodwife.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wood? Trees are wood. They have wives?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, silly! I am made of hollow wood. See.&#x201d; She turned around.<br>Jumper stared. From the back he saw that she was indeed hollow. Her round limbs and cones were empty, as was her head. Her shaped front outside was all there was of her.<br>She completed her turn and faced him again. &#x201c;So you see, I am something else. I wish I could bee a real girl, so I could make some real man happy, and not bee stalked by village louts who dew knot care what&#x2019;s inside as long as they can poke it from outside. But that simply is knot my nature.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I ... see,&#x201d; he said, orienting about three of his eight<br>eyes on her. It didn&#x2019;t help; she remained the shell of a woman.<br>&#x201c;And that is knot the worst of it. Com Pewter wants to make me into a Mother Board to fix his obsolescence. Because my animation is all in my wood shell. I could knot stand being shut up like that, so I&#x2019;m fleeing civilization. Knot that I was ever part of it; I am an innocent woodland creature.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand. I wouldn&#x2019;t like it either.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s no concern of yewrs. Yew saved me this time, and I&#x2019;ll bee more careful next time. I&#x2019;m really grateful. Is there any favor I can dew yew in return?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can you tell me how to return to my own realm?&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Yew can knot return, once yew&#x2019;ve been hooked. Yew have to finish the narrative.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But I was about to catch a succulent fly!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about that&#x2014;what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jumper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Jumper. I&#x2019;m Wenda. Wenda Woodwife, a fantasy female. I dew knot know why the narrative hook caught yew and put yew here; maybe it was just an accident. But yew&#x2019;re stuck in my world for the duration.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not comfortable here!&#x201d; That was an under statement, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure how to fill it out to full strength.<br>&#x201c;I understand, I think. I&#x2019;m knot comfortable being a fake girl; yew&#x2019;re knot comfortable being in an alien environment. Too bad we can knot solve each other&#x2019;s problems.&#x201d; Then she paused, looking at him. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My carapace?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;I wear my skeleton on the outside. Not that I have much of one. I am mostly soft body and hard legs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, that thing stuck to yewr back.&#x201d; She stepped forward and reached for it. It turned out to be a square paper with markings on it.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; he said, surprised.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a label, identifying yew.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know who I am. A lost spider.&#x201d;<br>She studied it. &#x201c;I think yew had better read it, Jumper. It seems to relate to yew.&#x201d; She handed it back to him.<br>Jumper took it with one foreleg and oriented an eye on it. To his surprise he found he could read. The tongues really were versatile.<br>PROPHECY<br>A Hero unfurls the Bra &amp; Girlls<br>The Good Magician will set the mission<br>Like the Ogre beware rogue her<br>Win Heart and Mind but be not blind<br>The Unicorn betrays the scorn<br>And Button Ghost unmasks the Host.<br>Jumper looked up. &#x201c;This makes little if any sense to me. What hero? What girls? What Ogre? What Unicorn? What Ghost?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I dew knot know. It may bee part of your problem I can knot solve.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Maybee it is part of the tangled web yew weave to confuse people.&#x201d;<br>Jumper folded the mystical note and tucked it under a fold of his carapace. &#x201c;I think I could solve your problem, at least. All you need is girl clothing and someone to watch your back to make sure no one else sees it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Clothing! Woodwives dew knot wear clothing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So it would make you seem more like a real girl.&#x201d;<br>Her little mouth dropped open. &#x201c;It wood, woodn&#x2019;t it? I never thought of that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re a forest creature. It shows in your speech.&#x201d; She considered. &#x201c;Clothing makes me think of the antistreaking agent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is something to put in wash water. It messes up the fauns and nymphs something awful, because then they<br>can knot streak.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br>She paused, assessing his incomprehension. &#x201c;It is complicated. But I might bee able to solve yewr problem, or tell yew how to. I thought it was just chance that brought me here right when yew arrived, but maybee that hook had a reason to drop yew near me. Because maybee we can help each other. What yew need to dew is go ask the Good Magician, as yewr Prophecy suggests.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe I know him, or even where he is. Would he know the answer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He knows the answer to everything. All yew have to dew is ask. Only then he makes yew pay for it with a year&#x2019;s service, or equivalent. So maybe that&#x2019;s knot for yew.&#x201d;<br>Now Jumper considered. &#x201c;If the alternative is to stay here in this foreign habitat, I might be better off with that year.&#x201d; Then he reconsidered. &#x201c;Except for one thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One thing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Spiders of my type live only about six months.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But yew&#x2019;re much bigger now. Shouldn&#x2019;t yew live lon ger? At least in this realm? Maybee six months in yewr realm is sixty years in this one.&#x201d;<br>He wasn&#x2019;t sure. &#x201c;Maybe so....</p></p><h2>The Privilege of the Sword</h2><p>Welcome to Riverside, where the aristocratic and the ambitious battle for power in the city's ballroom, brothels and boudoirs.

That, at least, is what I thought. This was before I had ever been to the city. I had never been in a duel, or held a sword myself. I had never kissed anyone, or had anyone try to kill me, or worn a velvet cloak. I had certainly never met my uncle the Mad Duke. Once I met him, much was explained.<br><br>***<br><br>On the day we received my uncle's letter, I was in the pantry counting our stock of silverware. Laden with lists, I joined my mother in the sunny parlor over the gardens where she was hemming kerchiefs. We did these things ourselves these days. Outside, I could hear the crows cawing in the hills, and the sheep bleating over them. I wasn't looking at her; my eyes were on the papers before me, and I was worrying about the spoons, which needed polishing, but we might have to sell them, so why bother now?<br><br>"Three hundred and thirteen spoons," I said, consulting the lists. "We're short three spoons from last time, Mother."<br><br>She did not reply. I looked up. My mother was staring out the window and gnawing on one end of her silky hair. I wish I had hair like that; mine curls, in all the wrong ways. "Do you think," she said at last, "that we should have that tree taken down?"<br><br>"We're doing silver inventory," I said sternly, "and we're short."<br><br>"Are you sure you have the right list? When did we count them last?"<br><br>"Gregory's Coming-of-Age party, I think. My hands smelt of polish all through dinner. And he never even thanked me for it, the pig."<br><br>"Oh, Katherine."<br><br>My mother has a way of saying my name as though it were an entire speech. This one included <i>When will you</i> and <i>How silly</i> and <i>I couldn't do without you</i> all at once. But I wasn't in the mood to hear it. While it must be done and there is no sense shirking, counting silver is not my favorite chore, although it ranks above fine needlework and making jam. <br><br>"I bet no one likes Greg there in the city, either, unless he's learned to be nicer to people." <br><br>There was a sudden jerky movement as she set her sewing down. I waited to be chastised. The silence became frightening. I looked to see that her hands were clutching the work down in her lap, regardless of what that was doing to the linen. She was holding her head very high, which was a mistake, because the moment I looked I knew from the set of her mouth and the wideness of her eyes that she was trying not to cry. Softly I put down my papers and knelt at her side, nestling in her skirts where I felt safe. "I'm sorry, Mama," I said, stroking the fabric. "I didn't mean it."<br><br>My mother twisted her finger in a lock of my hair. "Katie . . ." She breathed a long sigh. "I've had a letter from my brother."<br><br>My breath caught. "Oh, no! Is it the lawsuit? Are we ruined?"<br><br>"Quite the contrary." But she didn't smile. The line that had appeared between her brows last year only got deeper. "No, it's an invitation. To Tremontaine House."<br><br>My uncle the Mad Duke had never invited us to visit him. It wouldn't be decent. Everyone knew how he lived. But that wasn't the point. The point was that almost since I was born, he had been out to ruin us. It was utterly ridiculous: when he had just inherited vast riches from their grandmother, the Duchess Tremontaine, along with the title, he started dickering over the bit of land my mother had gotten from their parents for her dowry--or rather, his lawyers did. The points were all so obscure that only the lawyers seemed to understand them, and no one my father hired could ever get the better of them. We didn't lose the land; we just kept having to sink more and more money into lawyers, while the land my uncle was contesting went into a trust that made it unavailable to us, along with its revenues, which made it even harder to pay the lawyers. . . .<br><br>I was quite small, but I remember how awful it always was when the letters came, heavy with their alarming seals. There would be an hour or two of perfect, dreadful stillness, and then everything would explode. My father would shout all sorts of things at my mother about her mad family, and why couldn't she control them all, he might as well have married the goosegirl for all the good she did him! And she would cry it wasn't her fault her brother was mad, and why didn't he ask her parents what was wrong with the contract instead of badgering her, and hadn't she done her duty by him? I heard quite a lot of this because when the shouting started she would clutch me to her, and when it was over she and I would often sneak off to the pantry and steal a pot of jam and eat it under the stairs. At the dinner table my father would quarrel with my older brothers about the cost of Greg's horses or Seb's tutors, or what they should plant in the south reach, or what to do about tenants poaching rabbits. I was glad I was too young for him to pay much attention to; only sometimes he would take my face in his big hands and look at me hard, as if he were trying to find out which side of the family I favored. "You're a sensible girl," he'd say hopefully. "You're a help to your mother, aren't you?" Well, I tried to be. <br><br>Father died suddenly when I was eleven. Things got much quieter then. And just as suddenly, the lawsuits stopped as well. It was as if the Mad Duke Tremontaine had forgotten all about us.<br><br>Then, about a year ago, just when we had begun to stop counting every copper, the letters started coming again, with their heavy seals. It seemed the lawsuit was back.<br><br>My brother Sebastian begged to be allowed to go to the city to study law at University, but Seb was needed at home; he was much too clever about land and farming and things. Instead Gregory, who was Lord Talbert now, went to the city to find us new lawyers, and take his place on the Council of Lords. It was expensive having him there, and we were once again without the revenue from my mother's portion. If we didn't sell the spoons, we were going to have to sell some of my father's land, and everyone knows once you start chipping away at your estate, you're pretty much done for.<br><br>And now here was the Mad Duke, actually inviting us to the city to be his guests at Tremontaine House. My mother looked troubled, but I knew such an invitation could mean only one thing: an end to the horrible lawsuits, the awful letters. Surely all was forgiven and forgotten. We would go to town and take our place amongst the nobility there at last, with parties and dancing and music and jewels and clothes--I threw my arms around my mother's waist, and hugged her warmly. "Oh, Mama! I knew no one could stay angry with you forever. I am so happy for you!"<br><br>But she pulled away from me. "Don't be. The entire thing is ridiculous. It's out of the question." <br><br>"But--don't you wish to see your brother again? If I hadn't seen Greg or Seb for twenty years, I'd at least be curious."<br><br>"I know what Davey's like." She twisted the handkerchief in her hand. "He hasn't changed a bit. He fought with our parents all the time . . . " She stroked my hair. "You don't know how lucky you are, Kitty, to have such a kind and loving family. I know Papa was sometimes harsh, but he did care for all of us. And you and I have always been the best of friends, haven't we?"<br><br>I nodded. <br><br>"Davey and I were like that. Friends. Good friends, together against the world. We made up games, and protected each other. But people grow up, don't they? You can't stay a child forever. When my parents chose a husband for me, we were--he was--well, Davey just didn't understand that things must change."<br><br>"He hated Papa, didn't he?"<br><br>"He was only a boy; what did he know? Charles was a neighbor, not some stranger. My parents trusted him and knew he'd take good care of me. Of course I shed a few tears; I was a young girl, afraid to leave my home for the first time. My brother, though--well, he simply could not understand that, in the end, one has a duty to one's family. He never did, and he never will."<br><br>She was going to ruin that cloth, but I didn't want to stop her flow of words. A lot had happened in our family that no one had ever explained to me.<br><br>"And now it's the same thing all over again! " she cried, ripping the hem without seeing it. "Just when we thought things were about to get better, he went and made them worse, much worse, to please himself and hurt the rest of us. Just the same as now."<br><br>She started stabbing at the kerchief with her needle. "How?" I breathed, hoping to still her hands, hoping to keep the words coming. "How is it the same?"<br><br>"The duchess," my mother said, her lips tight. She wasn't even seeing me, I could tell; her eyes were on an invisible past when everything had gone wrong before I was born. "Our grandmother, the noble Duchess Tremontaine. Who didn't even come to my wedding; she still wasn't speaking to our mother. But she invited my brother to the city, to stay with her at Tremontaine House. It was his big chance--our big chance--to reconcile with her, to make something of himself. And what did he do? He ran away."<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"To University." She bit a thread in half. "Right there in the city, right under the duchess's very nose. Mother was beside herself. Gregory had just been born, and I had to leave him here all alone with your father and the servants to go and tend to her. You know what she was like." I nodded; Grandmother Campion had been terrifying. "Next we heard, he'd run away from University as well, gone to live in some city slum. We were sure he was dead. But he wasn't dead. He was bringing more shame on us by carrying on with a notorious swordsman. It all came out when the d...</p><h2>Knitting Lace Triangles</h2><p>Why Triangles? Visionary R.

According to author, expert garden designer, and TV host Smith, simply pick from the 63 ways to connect with nature. Each tip, a few paragraphs in length, is an exhortation of sorts, ranging from set a scene and adopt a no-fail houseplant (hint: mothers&#x2019;-in-law tongues work even in the dimmest of light) to cluster containers for bold effect and show off plant&#x2019;s stem. Lavish color photographs illustrate almost every tip. Not enough? Look for two-sentence (or so) boxed advice. Or a series of sidebars headlined Collections, with notes and pictures on such discoveries as begonias, Paris porcelain, and baskets, among many others. Want even more? A generous handful of recipes, paperwhites in a glass container and harvest home display, for two, enable more creative gardeners to showcase easy-to-complete handiwork.A fun-filled how-to retort to those who claim the black-thumb syndrome.

The author was one of a group of Cretans who tried to keep morale high and also act as intermediaries between the different groups of British on the island despite enormous dangers to their lives (three of the other early starters were captured and shot, two of them after long imprisonment and appalling torture).

Kirk is called again to the final frontier. His new mission: to lead a valiant group of settlers to a distant world, to defend the struggling colony from alien threats, and to explore the diverse mysteries and dangers of a strange new Earth! Far from the Federation, a newly discovered M-class world has been eyed as a potential home by a group of hardy and determined colonists. Star?eet can spare only one starship to escort the would-be settlers on their perilous voyage, but that ship is none other than the legendary <i>Starship Enterprise</i>&#x2122;, commanded by the most well-known captain in the quadrant. Now Kirk finds himself responsible for the lives of 30,000 men, women, and children -- a task that grows all the more difficult when the expedition is caught in the middle of an ancient feud between two dangerous alien races!</p><p>Diane Carey is the author of the bestselling INVASION!:FIRST STRIKE and numerous other Star Trek novels including episode tie-ins from The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, amongst them THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, TRIALS AND TRIBBLEATIONS and WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND (all DS9), both DS9 volumes of the bestselling DOMINION WAR quartet, EQUINOX and ENDGAME (both Voyager).<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Distant night, the most distant. Today, a giant's finger of tractless lingering haze dusted space deep cobalt blue, painting the otherwise ink matte of weeks past. Everything changed day by day, even space itself. </p><p> Or perhaps it was only anger. </p><p> Prowling the central command deck, surrounded by a raised walkway that supported all the consoles and monitors that showed him the universe, Captain James Kirk bedeviled his starship's forward viewscreen with a punitive glare, as if he could mentally brutalize what he saw into submission. </p><p> "Red alert," he ordered, "again." </p><p> "Captain," Lieutenant Commander Uhura broached from the communications post, "we never stood down from the previous one." </p><p> Kirk ignored her. "Get the owner over here right now. Sulu, detonate those shots." </p><p> "Trying, sir." </p><p> The starship's bridge pulsed with activity. Colored lights winked, and soft mechanical noises sang in the background, a self-driven symphony of never-ending background music that could seem either comforting or nerve-racking, depending upon the construction of any given peace or panic. </p><p> Today, Kirk let his nerves go ahead and rack. Somehow it was a message from the ship that she would act out his will, that he was still in charge. </p><p> "Mr. Spock," he asked, "is that drone automated or manned?" </p><p> On the upper deck walkway, watching the main screen like a cat on the hunt, the starship's first officer was as much comfort as Kirk would get on this mission. Sharp-eyed and dynamic, standing out on a bridge otherwise manned by humans, the Vulcan posed a narrow form particularly imperial in the new Starfleet colors of brick and black. His slick black hair, cut in the style of banks and points that now was famous in the Federation, caught a band of light from the red-alert beacon, which also framed the triangle of his left ear as he turned. "We're not certain whether it's manned, sir. Sensors pick up no life signs, but may be fouled by the industrial machinery on board. Some of Mrs. Webb's factory ships do have security guards stationed with sensitive data files." </p><p> "Then we can't blow it up -- yet. Invasive maneuvers, Mr. Sulu, get between that drone and <i>Oregon Trail</i>. Double shields port, right now." </p><p> "Port double shields, aye," the steady helmsman answered. Kirk was glad Sulu had come on this mission. Even though the course was essentially straight out into the middle of nowhere at noteworthy speeds, the helm at the hands of Hikaru Sulu somehow behaved just a thought better than at anyone else's. </p><p> The reassuring repeat of orders gave a sense of control to an uncontrolled situation. The starship moved forward through a magnificent funnel of spacefaring ships, every size and construction, that now moved aside for her. The view from here was eerie -- dozens after dozens of ships flooding past, heading back as the starship headed forward. At the helm, Commander Sulu hammered coordinates and traffic directions into his computer console, sweeping the flotilla away from the danger point. </p><p> Though only a few seconds of pause lay before him, Kirk stole those moments to commune silently with the great entourage of ships he was here to lead. Huge Conestoga-class dormitory ships, with their bird-beak bows and bulbous living sections, plowed past with deceiving grace, each pushed by brilliantly conceived devices designed just for this journey by Engineer Scott -- two detachable "mule" engines, huge rocks of unadorned muscle that could tow or push at fantastic ratios. Thus driven, the big people-mover ships were incarnations of the first iron horses steaming out toward treacherous frontiers, over scorching deserts, windy plains, and frozen mountains, hoping they'd make it to the other side. </p><p> Sprinkled among the Conestogas were private yachts, tenders, industrial drones, the mercy ship, the garden ship, the governor's VIP transport...What a sight. More than seventy ships, clustered in one area of space. Even after five months in space, it was shocking to look at them all, moving together in a great flock. Kirk was used to being in space, but alone out here, with his one powerful vessel, and the family of crew. Though the crew of four hundred had always seemed bulky as ships' complements went, Kirk had found new epiphanies in the past months, leading a convoy of over sixty-four thousand colonists to a promised land -- a land they had promised to themselves and were determined to settle, a dream they themselves had conjured and hammered into shape. </p><p> Here came the coroner ship, sedate and dignified in its promise to do whatever sad jobs came its way. Kirk tried to ignore the passing of <i>Twilight Sentinel,</i> but her presence off his starship's port bow jolted him back to the cold fact that he was facing a tragedy in the making and if he made the wrong decision, that ship would be full of bodies. </p><p> He pressed his hands to his command chair and pushed to his feet as the privateer ship <i>Hunter's Moon</i> slid past, her scratched black and green dazzlepainted hull gliding by at what seemed like arm's length. There, in the open space as the privateer cleared the viewscreen, was the tortured Conestoga <i>Oregon Trail,</i> being assaulted by a drone ship that had lost its mind. The functional-ugly drone, with its retractable docking claws all out, clutched at the Conestoga like a headless insect. Its flashes of torch phasers, several time brighter than they should be, crashed across the hulls of both free-floating vessels. Sparks danced into space, clouding the view. If those torches cut through the Conestoga's hide, this malfunction could quickly become a disaster. </p><p> Around him, the starship's refitted bridge glowed with the scarlet hue of red alert. In his misty mind, Kirk sometimes expected to see this place as it once had been, with its rows of etched black screens, the red rail, muted carpet, and grade-school colors that had seemed so crisp and happy. The refit had made the bridge more technical, more cold and metallic, but under the skin she murmured to him that she was still that old ship of his many adventures, the sturdy grand dame that had serviced the Federation so dependably. She recognized him despite the change, and he felt more at home by the hour. </p><p> At the engineering post, the convoy's senior engineer, Montgomery Scott, turned his iron-gray head and looked at the drone ship on the main screen harassing the Conestoga. Irritably he reported, "That damned box has sealed all its hatches now, sir. The hull's electrified and it keeps evading grapples. Nobody can get inside while the shields are up. The thing's gone completely raving." </p><p> Spock turned again. "Captain, I estimate eleven minutes to critical overload of those industrial phasers at this enhancement level." </p><p> Kirk flattened his lips. "Nothing compared to what'll happen when I get my hands on whoever enhanced them. Ah -- Captain Kilkenny." </p><p> "Kilvennan," came the correction. "Michael." </p><p> On the upper deck, just coming out of the turbolift, was one of the privateer captains, in fact the captain of <i>Hunter's Moon,</i> which had just sailed past. Escorted by Lieutenant Chekov, with shaggy long hair and a musketeer beard, Michael Kilvennan was everything James Kirk imagined the captain of folklore to be -- a mold that, ironically, he had never quite fit. Kilvennan wore a brown turtleneck and a belted sheepskin vest, setting him instantly apart from the starship's crew in their fitted blood-red uniform jackets and black trousers. In fact, the privateer captain looked uneasy standing next to the perpetually tidy Chekov. </p><p> "You better have a word with Mr. Chekov here," the privateer demanded. "Beaming me off my ship without permission -- " </p><p> "We don't have time for permission, Captain," Kirk told him sharply. "And I have emergency authority." He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder at the scene on the main viewer. "That one of your drones?" </p><p> "My mother runs the line of trailing industrial drones," Kilvennan confirmed, watching the action before them in space. "Helen Kilvennan Webb. She works on the CP <i>Crystobel,</i> but our family lives on the Yukon. She's the one who should be here. Those drones trail after the commercial pilot -- " </p><p> "Like little ducks," Kirk nodded. "You'll do for now. <i>Yukon's</i> under medical quarantine." </p><p> "I'll 'do'? Just because Mr. Chekov's handling Expedition security doesn't mean he gets to yank people off their own ships and haul them around the fleet." </p><p> "Yes, it does. Your mother's drone is attacking one of our passenger ships. I need to know what's on it right now and whether I'm free to destroy it if I have to." </p><p> Kilvennan scowled. "Who cares what's on it? Blow the damned thing up!" </p><p> A voice entered the argument from the upper deck. "Captain, you can't!" </p><p> Kirk turned -- so did everybody -- to the future colony's young governor as he raised a hand from where he stood next to Scott. An idealist's idealist, Evan Pardonnet was a man for whom youth provided a shield against the digs that picked away at beliefs and dreams. He had planned this massive one-stroke colonial movement, overlorded its every development, and bristled at the Federation's inclusion of Starfleet into the mix at the last minute. James Kirk had cast away his mantle of admiralty and once again put on a captain's hat, and accepted command of the Starship Enterprise to go into deep space, escorting and guarding the greatest colonial project in United Federation of Planets history. </p><p> Easy on the drawing board. Reality was a picker bush. For five months Kirk and Pardonnet had wrestled over who had authority to do what. In a crisis situation, should the colonists look to their fleet captain, or to their governor? Was there time for a committee meeting? The governor now argued his point in his usual way -- passionately. </p><p> "Mrs. Webb's line of drones," he protested, "is manufacturing things we'll need almost immediately to set up a decent first year on Belle Terre! We've got to protect it!" </p><p> "Blow it up," the owner's son repeated. Kilvennan seemed relaxed, but his eyes were fixed on the ghastly scene playing out in space, the drone ship carving plates off the <i>Oregon Trail's</i> weakening blue side. "Webb Three's a manufacturing plant making subassemblies for industrial goods. Kitchenware, that's all -- " </p><p> "Our ovens, ranges, refrigeration units!" The governor clenched and unclenched his hands until his palms were red. "Filtration systems, hydrators, dehydrators, waste-recyclers -- we need those, Captain Kirk!" </p><p> But Kilvennan stood his ground. "What good's that stuff if you let it kill three thousand colonists?" </p><p> Kirk swung to him. "What kind of phasers has that thing got, Kilvennan?" </p><p> "Ah...level-six cutting torches, I think -- " </p><p> "How'd they get up to level three?" </p><p> Pulling his hands from his pockets, Kilvennan bumped forward against the bridge rail. "Level three! That's impossible!" </p><p> "You're looking at it." </p><p> "Those are supposed to be level-six industrials, defensive at short range to deflect meteors! Cutting phasers, that's all!" </p><p> "Captain Kilvennan," Spock interrupted, "if your mother's had her phasers enhanced, she's in violation of Belle Terre Colonial Expedition statutes." </p><p> "And," Kirk firmly finished, "she'll be held criminally responsible for any deaths caused by that drone." </p><p> Kilvennan met him with a gale-force glare. "Who in hell do you think you are, making a charge like that? If those phasers are enhanced, they'll overload! Don't you think we know that?" </p><p> Meeting the other captain's anger point for point, Kirk snarled, "Is there any living person on board? Anyone at all?" </p><p> "Nobody. Webb Three, Four, Six, and Nine are all completely automated. My parents run them by telemetry from the CP." </p><p> At the comm station, Uhura had her hand to her earpiece. "Sir, Captain Briggs is hailing from the Tugantine. Should he move in with <i>Norfolk Rebel</i> and pry that drone off the Conestoga?" </p><p> "Not even the Tugantine's engines could break that drone's tractors," Kirk calculated. "Not under fire, anyway. Tell him to stand by." </p><p> Scott poked at his engineering controls and scowled. "The drone's tractored itself directly to the Conestoga's hull, sir. There's not two inches between them now." </p><p> Irreconcilably prowling the command deck, Kirk seized the problem and applied his pure will to it. The chilling sight of the factory drone chewing at a ship with three thousand passengers on board -- they might as well have been watching a cougar gnaw the leg of an elephant. Was there anything more frightening than a machine that had lost its mind? </p><p> Even through the gap of space between him and the Conestoga, he sensed the shrieks of fear, the huddling in horror, the confusion and desperation aboard that dormitory ship. He felt in his bones the painful thrumming of vibration from attack as it ran through the skin of the ship and up through the feet of those people and into their shuddering limbs. They were scared. He felt that. They needed him. He felt that too. </p><p> The bridge was all lit up with "windows" out to space. He saw all that was around them, all the ships of the Belle Terre Colonial Expedition, the thousands of civilians standing side by side with their spouses and children, watching what he would do next to save their neighbors, depending on him and judging him based upon the coming few minutes. </p><p> He hated an audience. Missions could be handled. Shows were messy. </p><p> Were they all thinking about the good old Earth they'd left behind, sinking into a gemlike backdrop, likely never to be seen again? Or were their minds on the planet they were heading toward, another Earth with clear skies and gleaming oceans, continents flushed as if they'd just been kissed? </p><p> Kirk was jolted as the last few ships cleared the way. The Conestoga <i>Lakota,</i> with her warp mule engines driving like Hadrian's elephants. The industrial ship <i>Macedon</i> towing an iceberg -- their water source in space. The huge <i>Olympian,</i> repository for thousands of micro-scaffolds growing body parts for cryo-freeze. The coroner ship <i>Twilight Sentinel</i> with her elegant purple hull and white lights, the dairy barge loaded with real cattle and real cowboys. Wreckmaster Briggs moving his Tugantine out of the way. Finally the Starfleet combat support tender Beowulf skimmed past the starship and flashed her running lights in a good-luck salute. </p><p> <i>Beowulf</i> was the last of the Expedition ships blocking the way. Now the Conestoga <i>Oregon Trail</i> and her bulldog attacker stood alone on the vista of space, glowing in the airbrushed light of a sun they were passing, and Kirk was at center stage. </p><p> "Nine minutes to overload." Spock's baritone voice pretended emotionlessness, but that was a lie. </p><p> "Captain," the governor pressed, "I know what you're thinking and I don't like it. The colonists are depending on those drones. Webb Three's the only one manufacturing appliance subsystems. The Webbs have spacedock facilities, computer components, all sorts of things critical to our setting up a viable spaceport in record time! ...</p></p><h2>Ducktails (Janette Oke&#39;s Animal Friends)</h2><p>This book follows young duckling Quackery and his siblings around the farmyard as they learn to appreciate the gift of life.

His photos and stories of the Navajo way of life are intertwined as surely as strands of a rope. The book is richly illustrated with full-color landscape photography and tells stories about the ancient ways and beliefs of the Navajo people. Noting that DeJolie focuses on a Holy Land, Tony Hillerman compares the Navajo Creation Story withte Bible&#39;s Book of Genesis.</p><p>Come, join photographer LeRoy DeJolie on a visual tour of Navajoland, his homeland, an expanse that he sees not only as a ruggedly beautiful territory in the Four Corners region but also as the cradle of his heritage.And read writer LeRoy DeJolie&#39;s accounts of the Navajo way of life and religion, whch are intertwined as surely as strands of a rope.As you embark on this journey, bear in mind a point made by Tony Hillerman in his foreword - that the Navajo photographer focuses on a Holy Land. Hillerman&#39;s analogy compares the Navajo Creation Story with the Bible&#39;s Book of Genesis.In the coming pages, youw ill experience Navajoland as a Navajo does and in the way he wants others to experience it - not just as a wondrous landscape but also as a place with which to spiritually connect. For example, when a visitor to Navajoland sees Spider Rock, he or she sees a tall, sculpted tower rising from the floor of Canyon de Chelly. A Navajo sees the monolith as the home of Spider woman, who taught the Navajo people how to weave. Some Navajo parents also use the white-capped rock to help teach their children how to act in a harmonious, balanced manner.This book also displays photographic portfolios cnetering on each of the Navajos&#39; four sacred mountains. Each portfolio is preceded by a vignette describing the physical features of each mountain and its significance in Navajo mythology.Indeed, in Navajoland, a native sone shares his legacy.I see my work more as a mission than a job, says LeRoy DeJolie. It is my lifetime ambition to help preserve the heritage our Navajo ancestors desired for succeeding generations - a heritage that intertwines with the land. For many of oru people, that heritage is vanishing from their lives and memories as they are swept into the more cominant culturues aroud us.</p><h2>The Spring Classics: Cycling&#39;s Greatest One-Day Races</h2><p><p>Cycling&#x2019;s spring races are always the most anticipated of the year, not only because they herald the start of the season, but also because they are brutally difficult and spectacularly unpredictable.

The crowning moment of Hogan&#x2019;s comeback was his dramatic victory in the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club near Philadelphia, where his battered legs could barely carry him on the 36-hole final day. <i>Miracle at Merion</i> tells the stirring story of Hogan&#x2019;s triumph over adversity&#x2014;the rarely-performed surgery that saved his life, the months of rehabilitation when he couldn&#x2019;t even hit a golf ball, his stunning return to competition at the Los Angeles Open, and, finally, the U.S. Open triumph that returned him to the pinnacle of the game.<br><br> While Hogan was severely injured in the accident, fracturing his pelvis, collarbone, rib, and ankle, his life wasn&#x2019;t in danger until two weeks later when blood clots developed in his leg, necessitating emergency surgery. Hogan didn&#x2019;t leave the hospital until April and didn&#x2019;t even touch a golf club until August. It wasn&#x2019;t until November, more than nine months after the accident, that he was able to go to the range to hit balls. Hogan&#x2019;s performance at the Los Angeles Open in early January convinced Hollywood to make a movie out of his life and comeback (Follow the Sun, starring Glenn Ford). Five months later, Hogan completed his miraculous comeback by winning the U.S. Open in a riveting 36-hole playoff against Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio, permanently cementing his legacy as one of the sport&#x2019;s true legends.</p><p><strong>David Barrett</strong> has been a professional golf writer for more than thirty years. For eighteen years, Barrett served as an editor at <i>Golf</i> magazine, where he wrote the popular &#x201c;Within the Rules&#x201d; column. He presently serves as editor-in-chief of <i>Fairway Living</i> magazine. He is a regular contributor to <i>GolfObserver.com</i> and the author of several previous books on golf including <i>Golfing with Dad</i> and <i>Miracle at Merion</i>, which was awarded the USGA&#x2019;s 2010 Herbert Warren Wind Award as the year&#x2019;s best book on golf.When golfer Ben Hogan won the 1950 U.S. Open less than two years after nearly dying in a car crash, sportswriter Red Smith called the comeback &#x201c;the most remarkable feat in the history of sports.&#x201d; Sixty years later, though, the details of Hogan&#x2019;s ordeal have dimmed, even for avid golf fans. Barrett&#x2019;s well-researched recounting of the tournament and the events that led up to it brings the remarkable story back to vivid life. Nothing was easy for Hogan, who grew up poor in the shadow of his father&#x2019;s suicide and struggled for years to perfect his golf swing. It all came together for him in the late 1940s, however, but his career seemed over after the accident. Determined to play again, despite permanent damage to his legs, Hogan put his game back together in time for the Open, tying for the lead on the final day, after a 36-hole endurance test, and winning the 18-hole playoff the next day. Barrett lacks the flair for narrative nonfiction that distinguishes Mark Frost&#x2019;s similar accounts of great moments in golf history, but in this case, the facts speak for themselves. A must-read for anyone who cares about golf. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Mega Gifts: 2nd Edition, Revised &amp; Updated</h2><p>Want to know what motivates donors to give big gifts? There is an easy way to find out. Ask them. That is what Jerold Panas did for his book, Mega Gifts: Who Gives Them, Who Gets Them. Rather than speculate about what prompted so and so to give $25,000, or $100,000 or $1,000,000, Panas rang them up and said, Can I come talk with you? Admittedly, that is easy for Panas who knows practically everyone save Benedict XVI. Panas winnowed his questions down to the most revealing: what prompts you to give, what about the person soliciting you is important, what do you look for in an organization, what immediately turns you off, to what extent do the board and CEO matter to you, how does an organization keep you giving, and a handful of others.

Desiderio da Settignano (ca. 1429/30-1464), like most sculptors before Michelangelo, was long overlooked by scholars, who focused their attention almost exclusively on Donatello, the great master of the quattrocento. And yet Desiderio, who may have begun his career in Donatello&#39;s workshop, became one of the most original and influential sculptors in Florence. His impact is clear in the numerous replicas of his Virgin and Child reliefs as well as copies of the Bambino in the Basilica of San Lorenzo. His work, showing an early interest in sfumato, may even have influenced the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci. Sweetness, strength, and luminosity are the principal qualities of Desiderio&#39;s oeuvre . The expressive power, emotion, lightness, and grace visible in his work affirm the place he now occupies not only in the history of sculpture but also in the history of art.

She was born in Washington DC in 1956, the second of four children. They didn't move around quite as much as one might expect after such a beginning: Washington was followed merely by Santiago, Chile, and two locations in Michigan. Gillian attended the University of Michigan, where she earned her BA in English and another in Classical Greek, and won the Hopwood Prize for fiction with her first novel, <i>Hawk of May</i>. She went on to get another degree at Newnham College, Cambridge University, England in Greek and Latin literature, and she sold her first novel while preparing for exams.<br><br>She decided to stay in Cambridge another year to write another novel and think about what to do for a Real Job. However, while there, she discovered she could live on her income as a novelist and also met her husband, who was completing his doctorate in physics. Between books and children she never did get a Real Job, and she's been writing novels ever since. <br><br>She and her husband now live in Coventry. They have four children and a dog.<br><i>I</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We mutinied when we reached the ocean.<br>We'd been riding for fifty-one days, three companies of us with half a legion and two troops of Roman auxiliaries to guard us. We left Aquincum late in July, and rode through the heat of August: the dust and the flies were appalling. Most of the army bases where we stopped along the way didn't have proper supplies laid up for such a large body of men, as nobody had sent messages telling them to do so; of what they did have, the Roman troops took the best for themselves, leaving us sour barley soup and coarse black bread. We weren't used to the diet, and it made us ill. The hooves of our horses wore down on the paved Roman roads, and the beasts went lame. The Romans refused to give us leather to make horse-sandals, so we cut up the leather bindings of our wagons awnings. Then, early in September when we left the Rhine and turned west into Gaul, it began to rain, and the water ran through the loose awnings and soaked everything: bedding, food, clothes. Everything stank of wet wool, wet horses, rotting barley, and unwashed wet men, and we hated the hell of our own skis. Only our armor and weapons were safe: they had been wrapped in oilcloths at Aquincum and packed into twenty wagons of their own, which the Romans took charge of.<br>Then one afternoon, just before the middle of September, we were starting down from the hills when we saw it: the ocean. It had rained all that morning, but the rain had stopped about midday, and now the sky was clearing. The clouds parted and let down a watery light westward beyond us, and we looked up and saw a huge gray plain turn suddenly and impossibly blue. We had never seen the sea. We reined in our horses and stopped in the road, starting at it. The sun shimmered on the waves as far out as our eyes could see: no shadow of land darkened even the farthest limit of the horizon.<br>"It's the end of the world!" whispered Arshak.<br>Gatalas gave a long wail of grief and dismay and covered his face. The sound rose up above the clatter and rumble of the troops behind us and before us, and when it stopped, there was complete silence. Then there was a rustling whisper--"What is it?" "The sea, we've reached the sea"--running back down the line. A few dozen men and horses trotted forward, leaving the road and fanning out across the hill. Then was silence again.<br>Marcus Flavius Facilis, the senior centurion in charge of us, came galloping us from some discussion with his subordinates. He was a stocky, bull-necked man, white-haired, with a face that went crimson when he was angry. It was beginning to go crimson now. "What's the matter with you bastards now?" he demanded, in Latin. He always ways spoke to us in his own language, though few of the officers and even fewer of the men understood it. During the long journey he had not bothered to learn Sarmatian even enough to give us orders.<br>Arshak, who did understand it, pointed at the sea. Gatalas didn't even look at him, but say with his hands over his face, rocking back and forth in his saddle.<br>Facilis only glanced at the sea. His eyes slid lightly away from that shining vision of blue and silver, and fixed instead on the city down the hill from us, a comfortable huddle of red life tile and gray thatch. He sat back in his saddle with a grunt of satisfaction. "Bononia!" he exclaimed, almost cheerfully. "Bononia at last! That's where we'll be staying tonight. And tomorrow I can say good-bye to the whole stinking lot of you. Come on, you bastards: hurry up and you'll sleep in dry beds tonight."<br>"And tomorrow?" asked Arshak, very quietly. "Where will we sleep tomorrow?"<br>"That depends how long it takes to embark you all," replied Facilis. "I imagine it will take a few days to ferry all of you across."<br>"They said there was an island," said Arshak, still very quietly. "They said that we would be sent to an island called Britain, and there we would have our weapons back, and be accepted as soldiers of the Romans, and receive honorable appointments and payment for our service. That is what the emperor himself swore to us at Aquincum."<br>"Yes," agreed Facilis, "and the sooner you get down this hill--"<br>"There is no island," said Arshak.<br>"May I persih!" said Facilis, going red again. "What the hell do you mean?"<br>Gatalas took his hands away from his face. "There is nothing there!" he screamed. "Nothing! Nothing but ocean!" He turned his head away from that terrible immensity.<br>"You pigheaded barbarians!" shouted Facilis. "You stinking idiots! Of course there's an island. It's across there"--he waved his hand at the sea--"about thirty miles off."<br>Arshak shook his head. "No," he said, "no. You lie to us, Roman. You lied to us all along. You, the emperor, all of you. You lie. There is no island."<br>Facilis' face was growing steadily reader. "You stupid bastard! By every god on earth or under it! Why would I march a troop of lunatic Sarmatians all the way from Aquincum to Bononia if there wasn't anywhere to send them when we got there? I wouldn't do it for the love of barbarian company, I can promise you that!"<br>"You would do it to cause our deaths," replied Arshak, still very quietly. He never raised his voice when he was angry, never swore, and never boasted. He was a member of the royal clan, second son of the king's own brother, and he had been taught that a nobleman answers insults only with his spear. It was lucky that the spear was stowed away in the weapons wagons, with Facilis' men guarding it. Otherwise Facilis would have been dead several times over, and Arshak as well, executed for murdering a Roman officer.<br>Facilis glared at him. He wiped his hands down the sides of his tunic. "The emperor wants you alive," he declared. "He wants you in his army. He swore to give you honorable posts, and you swore to serve him faithfully. Do you mean to break your oaths now, just because you've seen the sea?"<br>"The emperor wanted to kill our whole nation," Arshak returned. "He lied to us."<br>"If we go there," said Gatalas, jabbing a hand fearfully toward the sea, "we will die in the water."<br>"No!" Facilis insisted. He did not bother to deny that the emperor had wanted to exterminate our whole nation--everyone knew that was true--but he turned instead to his first point. "There is an island there."<br>We all stared at him.<br>"There's a huge island there, you stupid bastards! There's whole Roman province, with cities and roads and three legions and the gods know how many troops of auxiliaries! The ocean's bigger than the gods-hated Danube, you idiots: you can't expect to see clear across it!"<br>Arshak glanced up the hill behind us. Behind a handful of our officers, Facilis' legionaries waited, leaning on their javelins and watching us. Two full cohorts of them, sixteen hundred men, drawn up six abreast: their ranks stretched up the road out of sight. The rest of our men were behind them, and the wagon with the weapons were still farther away, with the baggage. Of the two troops of Roman auxiliary cavalry, one was strung out down the road before us, waiting, and the other was guarding the baggage.<br>Arshak looked back at Facilis and smiled. Then, saying nothing, he touched his horse and started down the hill again, and the rest of us followed him in silence. Facilis sat still on his own horse, swearing as we rode past.<br>"We will not go on their ships," said Gatalas, in Sarmatian, when we were well ahead of him.<br>"Of course not," replied Arshak. "It's a trick. We'd be helpless on a ship, with our horses packed in a hold like sheep, and our weapons left onshore. They wouldn't even need to use swords on us. A few good swimmers could take us out, sink us and the vessel, and escape themselves without the least danger."<br>"Death in battle is better than drowning," Gatalas declared, rubbing the hilt of his dagger. "But I'd prefer it if I had something more than this and a rope to fight with. Do you think we could get our weapons back?"<br>"Probably," said Arshak, almost eagerly. "My men have managed to keep thirty bows, forty quivers of arrows, and sixty swords hidden in our wagons. How many do your troops have?"<br>"Fifty bows and twenty-seven swords," Gatalas replied promptly. "But only thirty quivers of arrows."<br>"Ariantes?"<br>"Fifty-nine bows, sixty quivers of arrows, and a dozen swords," I said, reluctantly. "But they're all well hidden, and it will take a little time to get them out. Facilis is suspicious. He'll find some way to obstruct us. Either we won't be allowed near our wagons, or we won't be allowed near our men, or both."<br>"Facilis won't be in charge in Bononia," Arshak answered confidently. "The camp will have its own commander. Bononia's a big place; the commander will be an important man, a legate or a procurator. You must have noticed how ever tribunes don't like taking orders from centurions, however senior. It won't take much to ensure that we're sent off to the wagons with our men." Arshak smiled again, then added vehemently, "Facilis is mine."<br>I sighed. I was not sure what I felt when I looked at the sea, but it was not anger or fear. Perhaps it was hope. I'd had enough of the worlds I knew, Sarmatian and Roman both, and here we'd ridden to the world's end and were climbing down to touch something huge and mysterious beyond it. Why should I stop, here in this Roman city? Why not go on? I remembered the time long before when I had journeyed east, hoping to reach the Jade Gate of the Silk Country. I had been called back, halfway there. I regretted that still. Why stop again now, just short of the ocean?<br>Of course, I was tired. Some things had happened in the Roman war that had left me stunned, and when the war ended, I felt like one of the dead. I had a leg wound, too, which had meant that I'd ridden the first seven hundred miles of the journey with my leg in a splint, dazed with pain, and I'd floated through them in a kind of dream. Sometimes I woke up with a start and stared at myself in astonishment, but mostly I rode, ate, made camp, and gave orders to my men, all as though I were trailing behind myself and watching.<br>"What if they're telling the truth?" I asked. "What if there is an island?"<br>"Why should you believe them?" returned Arshak, swiftly and angrily. "Why should we trust them?"<br>"I don't trust them," I answered wearily. "But we swore oaths to the emperor, and we aren't yet certain that he was lying. If we fight them now, we will all die. You want to kill Facilis--but if you have to pay for the pleasure with the blood of all your men, is it worth it? Even if we managed to win our weapons, even if we gave them such a battering that they locked themselves in their forts and us out, still we couldn't get home, not through a thousand miles of land held by our enemies. And the emperor would look at what we'd done, and note that even when Sarmatian troops surrender in a peace settlement, they can still rebel and shed Roman blood. He'd have no use for Sarmatian troops ever again. What could our people give then, to buy peace?"<br>Arshak scowled. "He wanted to kill us all anyway. He has betrayed us and he will betray those at home, whatever we do."<br>"Better to die on land than in the water," agreed Gatalas. "At leas on land the soul can fly free to the sun."<br>"But what if there is an island? If there is an island, it would be we who first betrayed them."<br>"An island in the ocean, beyond the limit of the world!" scoffed Arshak. "And what's more, an invisible one! If Facilis told you that there was an island in the sky and that you must climb up a mountain and jump off to reach it--would you believe him, and jump?"<br>"I wouldn't choose a path that would end with all my men dead without at least tossing a stone off the mountain and looking where it landed! And I am not sure that the Romans would invent a Roman province across the ocean, simply to trick us. Britain may well lie thirty miles from here."<br>"I will not cross the ocean!" cried Gatalas. "I will die cleanly in this world, and so will my men!" He stretched his hand toward the sun. "On fire I swear it!"<br>We rode on for a moment with the oath ringing in our ears. There didn't seem to be any point in continuing the argument.<br>But I couldn't leave it. When we reached this camp, we would have to begin planning our mutiny--and the more I considered it, the les likely it seemed that the Romans had invented Britain to deceive us. I had five hundred men who depended upon me to do what was best for them. "If I went," I said at last, reluctantly, "on my own, without you, without any of my own people--if I went to see if this island was there, and came back and reported to you that it was--what would you do then?"<br>Gatalas looked at me fearfully. "What if it's not an earthly island?" he asked, in a low voice. "If it's there, beyond the ocean, it might be...a place where the dead walk. What would you be like if you came back then?"<br>"You'd still know, then, from looking at me, that you should not cross. You'd be free to fight the Romans with a clear conscience."<br>"I'm not sure we'd notice any difference if you came back as a ghost, Ariantes," Arshak said, trying to lighten the air a little. I met his eyes, and he dropped his smile: the joke was too true to be funny.<br>"Someone should check what the truth is before we take up arms," I said.<br>"And if they refuse to let you go and come back again?" Arshak demanded.<br>"Then, again, we'll know that they're lying and we need have no doubts about fighting them."<br>"Very well, very well," Arshak said quietly. "Very well. You're right: we must toss our stone off the mountain and see where it falls. A pity: my hands ache for a spear every time I see Facilis, and I will regret it as long as I live if he goes home to Aquincum unharmed." After a moment he added, "And you're willing to go? Because I'm not. It would mean swallowing what I said to Facilis."<br>"I am willing to go," I said. "I'll tell Facilis as much this evening. Can I tell him that if we know he's acting in good faith, we will go on their ships?"<br>Gatalas flinched, but, after a moment, nodded. "I will not be the first to break an oath."<br>"Nor will I," said Arshak again, unhappily. "But we'll see what we can arrange for the Romans if it happens that they're lying."<br>Arshak was quite right about at least one thing, however: the procurator of the naval base where we stopped that night did not want to take his orders from Flavius Facilis. He'd had letters about us, and when we arrived he came out to the gate to look at us. It was easy for us to guess who the figure standing on the battlement was: he was wearing the long crimson cloak and gilded armor, and when we got closer we could see he had the narrow purple stripe on his tunic, marking him as a member of the Roman equestrian order. Arshak galloped up to the gate, stopped his horse, saluted respectfully, greeted him as "Lord," and asked him where we could put our wagons. By the time Facilis had cantered up and suggested that we be confined to barracks instead, the procurator had already granted us leave to arrange the wagons in the shipyard, and wouldn't back down: an equestrian appointed by the emperor doesn't change his arrangements because a centurion who struggled up through the ranks thinks he ought to. Facilis turned crimson and swore under his breath, but had to accept it. He followed ...</p><h2>America: The Men and Their Guns That Made Her Great</h2><p>The turbulent years from the American Revolution to the First World War saw not only the forming of a great nation, but gave special meaning for all time to the designation, &#34;American&#34;. Men like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln added much to that word, but so did thousands of our forebears, many long since forgotten. Ours is not a nation of a few great men, but of many who share the individualism, idealism, and determination that formed the nucleus of this country. In these pages you will meet a varied group of Americans -- the great, the near-great, the hero, the scoundrel, the obscure, such as: Timothy Murphy, Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton, Sam Colt, Buffalo Bill, Annie Oakley, Teddy Roosevelt, and others. All -- some by design, some by circumstance -- had their spirit tested in the forming of our great nation. The way they and so many others met that challenge gave meaning to the word &#34;American&#34;. These are just a few of the men -- and their guns -- that made America great.

At this time, more than twenty-five countries are developing, or have stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, in many cases in sufficient quantities to wipe out the entire population of the world. <p>So far the danger of chemical and biological aggression has been little acknowledged, and, at least in America, little prepared for by federal and local government. Most terrorist threats and attacks are not widely reported in the mainstream media. Although information about the proliferation of man-made diseases is carefully suppressed by governments and the media they will be covered in the pages of this book. </p><p>Not only is America unprepared and ignorant of what is happening, but the people in government and scientific professions who do know, who should be warning the American public about the dangers of chemical and biological terrorism, are instead doing their utmost to hide this information from us; information that is vital for our survival. </p><p>The information that is contained in the pages of this book will not be measured or calculated to reassure people that every-thing is fine, when reassurance is the exact opposite of what is needed at this time. It may even give you nightmares when you realize the real circumstance that we are in.

Many writers, such as Ed Hewett in Reforming the Soviet Economy: Equality versus Efficiency ( LJ 4/15/88), have examined Soviet problems and the solutions proposed in "perestroika," without committing to any firm predictions. In this book, Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, looks at the history of Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism, current Soviet problems, and the state of the global Communist movement, and argues that Gorbachev's reforms cannot revitalize a system that is in inevitable decline.

Through this book Matthew Kelly will help you discover your legitimate needs, deepest desires, and unique talents&#x2014;and become the-best-version-of-yourself. He helps you bring into focus who you are, why you are here, and what possibilities stand before you<i>...</i><br> <br><i>Everything is a choice. This is life&#x2019;s greatest truth and its hardest lesson. It is a great truth because it reminds us of our power to live the life of our dreams. It is a hard lesson because it causes us to realize that we have chosen the life we are living right now.</i><br> <br><i>The measure of your life will be the measure of your courage. Fear stops more people from doing something with their lives than lack of ability, contacts, resources, or any other single variable. Fear paralyzes the human spirit. Life takes courage.</i><br> <br><i></i>With this groundbreaking guide, Kelly cuts through the stifling clutter of our everyday lives and delivers a clarity that is both refreshing and liberating.</p><p>Matthew Kelly, the charismatic minister, speaker and best-selling author from down under, wants you to live life out loud and on purpose. In this expanded version of <i>The Rhythm of Life</i> he syntheses Christian theology, cognitive psychology and storytelling to unpack the paradox of being happy. As Kelly explains, "We want to be happy. We know what makes us happy. But we don't do those things--because we are busy trying to be happy." So here's the gospel according to Kelly: Find a life-changing rhythm by choosing a central purpose and becoming "the best version of yourself." With examples draw from his own life and diverse cast of characters including Charlie Chaplin, Jude the apostle, piano man Billy Joel, the Magi, and Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, he maps the way to a meaningful life. Kelly makes thoughtful distinctions. He contrasts the difference between doing and having, the legitimate need for health and happiness with the illegitimate desire for expensive toys and the pursuit of minimalism vs. excellence. Then he gets specific, offering five questions about life's meaning, three instruments for anchoring your life and ten principles of excellence. At times, Kelly seems to be recycling his speeches and sermons or downplaying his religious stripes to seek a wider audience. And he lets cliches share the pages with memorable gems. But Kelly's gift is to convey the much-discussed ideas of personal accountability, mind management, and spirituality with passion and clarity. <i>Barbara Mackoff</i><b>Matthew Kelly</b>, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Rhythm of Life</i>, has been captivating audiences around the world since his late teens.

And yet, archaeology reveals that Native Americans lived in the region at least 13,000 years before such European incursions. <i>Archaeology of Minnesota </i>tells their story&#x2014;or as much as the region&#x2019;s wealth of artifacts, evidence of human activity, and animal and plant remains can convey.<br><br>From archaeological materials, Guy Gibbon reconstructs the social, economic, and political systems&#x2014;the lifeways&#x2014;of those who inhabited what we now call Minnesota for thousands of years before the first contact between native peoples and Europeans. From the boreal coniferous forests to the north, to the tall grass prairie to the west and southwest, to the deciduous forest to the east and southeast, the richly diverse land of the upper Mississippi River region, crossed and bordered by all manner of waterways, was a virtual melting pot of prehistoric cultures.</p><p>Demonstrating how native cultures adapted and evolved over time, Gibbon provides an explanation that is firmly rooted in the nature of local environments. In doing so, he shows how the study of Minnesota archaeology is relevant to a broader understanding of long-term patterns of change in human development throughout the world.<i><br><br></i></p></p><p><p>Guy Gibbon is professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Minnesota. He is the author or editor of several books, including <i>The Sioux: The Dakota and Lakota Nations and Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia.</i></p>"Guy Gibbon constructs a multifaceted story of precontact Minnesota as evidenced from thousands of archaeological discoveries. Carefully interweaving crucial environmental variables with dynamic cultural processes, the character of indigenous lifeways found throughout the state over the past 13,000 years emerges. "Archaeology of Minnesota "offers both an admirable chronicle of the state's deep history as well as a compelling case for why understanding the archaeological past matters." --Lynn M. Alex, University of Iowa, Office of the State Archaeologist<br>"In "Archaeology of Minnesota", Guy Gibbon chronicles the 13,000 year prehistoric record in the state. Much more than just dates, artifact lists, and site summaries, Gibbon presents Minnesota archaeology in a highly readable and informative matter that is both stimulating and challenging. This tour de force on Minnesota's past was long awaited, and Gibbon, whose record of scholarship and familiarity with Minnesota archaeology is well-known, does not disappoint." --Joseph A. Tiffany, Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse<br></p><h2>The Mooring Of Starting Out: The First Five Books of Poetry</h2><p><p>Most critics would agree that John Ashbery is one of 20th-century American poetry's finest voices. Perhaps his most admired book is <em>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,</em> a culmination of themes, styles, and forms with which the poet experimented over the course of two decades. Now, the poet's devoted readers can trace his development through the first five books of his poetry, collected here in one handy volume. <em>The Mooring of Starting Out</em> represents Ashbery's work from 1956 through 1972, comprising <em>Some Trees,</em> his first book; <em>The Tennis Court Oath,</em> written while he was living in Paris.</p></p><p><p>John Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York, in 1927. He wrote more than twenty books of poetry, including <em>Quick Question; Planisphere; Notes from the Air; A Worldly Country; Where Shall I Wander; </em>and <em>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, </em>which received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the National Book Award. The winner of many prizes and awards, both nationally and internationally, he received the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation in 2011 and a National Humanities Medal, presented by President Obama at the White House, in 2012. Ashbery died in September 2017 at the age of ninety.</p>&#34;His poetry appeals not because it offers wisdom in a packaged form, but because the elusiveness and mysterious promise of his lines remind us that we always have a future and a condition of meaningfulness to start out toward. This book of beginnings takes us back to the mooring of John Ashbery&#39;s starting out, &#39;that day so long ago.&#39; It contains a poetry whose beauties are endless.&#34;-- &#34;New York Times Book Review&#34;&#34;Ashbery&#39;s poems do not evade the real; they deny it the power to prevent other realities from being conceived.&#34;-- Paul Gray, &#34;Time&#34;&#34;This is the best possible introduction to the brilliant, difficult, and beautiful work of this poet.&#34;-- &#34;Publishers Weekly&#34;&#34;No one writing poems in the English language is likelier than Ashbery to survive the severe judgments of time.... He is joining that American sequence that includes Whitman, Dickinson, Stevens, and Hart Crane.&#34;-- &#34;Harold Bloom&#34;&#34;The chances are very good that [Ashbery] will come to dominate the last third of this century as Yeats dominated the first.&#34;-- &#34;Poetry&#34;</p><h2>Beyond Reason</h2><p>Photo illustrated - autobiography - BCE</p><p></p><h2>The Usborne Book of Fairy Tales</h2><p>Retells six classic fairy tales that involve royalty or animals.</p><p></p><h2>Dragonsword</h2><p>MINOR WEAR ON EDGES OF COVERS.

Peary, critic and author of numerous film books including the Cult Movies volumes (Vol. 1; LJ 10/1/81), is the kind of person one wants to sit and talk film with. Here, in year-by-year format, he gives the Oscar recipients and nominees for best motion picture, best actor, and best actress. He then follows with his choices and worthy runners-up. Each pick includes a review in Peary's lively and frequently amusing style. He points out standard Oscar mistakes: e.g., Citizen Kane (1941) and Dr. Strangelove (1963) should have each won best picture awards; Henry Fonda should have won best actor for Grapes of Wrath (1940). He notes that not only did Psycho (1960) and Singin ' in the Rain (1952) not win, they weren't even nominated.

His caricatures are the best, and he is the artist that defines <i>MAD</i> for me.<br><br>When I had to choose an artist for the <i>American Graffiti</i> poster, Mort was the first and only person who came to mind.

She was then shackled and returned to her jail cell. Just years ago, the pretty, personable Seattle schoolteacher was living a life many would envy-- she had a handsome husband, four beautiful children, and a beloved following of students. Then she was accused of child rape, and her whole world turned upside down.<br><br>Rapist Or Victim?<br>How did a 34-year-old married teacher fall in love with one of her sixth-grade students? Was it a complete lapse of judgment, or-- as she contends-- the meeting of two soulmates? Were the two planning to run away together-- before police caught them in a parked car? Did the couple have illicit sex in every room of the Letourneau house, as the teenager told the tabloids? Read about the case that shocked the world and rocked the headlines-- about the lonely life of Mary Kay Letourneau and the young object of her obsession, the boy who fathered two of her children. You may think you know the story of Mary Kay Letourneau-- but you don't know the whole story until you've read...<i>If Loving You Is Wrong</i>.<br><br>Includes interviews with Mary Kay Letourneau.<br><br></p><p>The tale seems ripe for tabloid exploitation: the fresh-faced blond elementary schoolteacher and mother of four just couldn't keep her hands off that 13-year-old boy. Worse yet, Mary Kay Letourneau had become obsessed with the slight, Samoan teenager while he was still a student in her sixth-grade class--and he fathered two babies with her. Yet in the hands of true crime writer Gregg Olsen, <i>If Loving You Is Wrong</i> becomes a poignant profile of an emotionally stunted young woman tightly wound up in a web of lies too fragile to sustain the weight of her own compulsions.<p> The facade the Letourneaus presented to the world was that of a devoted, upwardly mobile young couple. In reality Steve and Mary Kay were on the verge of financial and emotional bankruptcy. They married because she'd become pregnant and appearances were everything to Mary Kay's parents, ultra-conservative, family-values-promoting politician John Schmitz and his icy wife, Mary. Olsen, whose previous books include <i>Abandoned Prayers</i> and <i>Black Widow</i>, does a superior job with the story, interviewing Letourneau herself as well as friends and neighbors, researching and assembling the facts behind the lurid headlines in a nonjudgmental manner that allows readers to draw their own conclusions about the bigger issues at stake. Was Mary Kay Letourneau a pedophile, a child rapist, a female Humbert Humbert? Or was she, as she claims, a woman who'd found a soul mate and a true love that defied America's puritanical norms? Read <i>If Loving You Is Wrong</i> and decide for yourself. <i>--Patrizia DiLucchio</i></p><br>Gregg Olsen is the acclaimed author of several true crime books, including: <i>The Confessions of an American Black Widow</i>, <i>Abandoned Prayers</i>, <i>Bitter Almonds</i>, <i>Mockingbird</i>, and <i>Starvation Heights</i>.<br><br></p><h2>Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before</h2><p>Amazon.com Review Captain James Cook&#39;s three epic 18th-century explorations of the Pacific Ocean were the last of their kind, literally completing the map of the world. Yet despite his monumental discoveries, principally in the South Pacific, Cook the man has remained an enigma. In retracing key legs of the circumnavigator&#39;s journey, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tony Horwitz chronicles the cultural and environmental havoc wrought by the captain&#39;s opening of the unspoiled Pacific to the West, as well as the alternately indifferent and passionate reactions Cook&#39;s name evokes during the writer&#39;s journeys through Polynesia, Australia, the Aleutians, and the explorer&#39;s native England. Horwitz skillfully weaves a biography and travel narrative with warm humor that is natural and human-scale, and his restless inquisitiveness quickly infects the reader. While striking dichotomies abound throughout that journey--Maori toughs who adopt Nazi imagery to symbolize their own fight against white domination, millennia-old Polynesian sexual mores that would shame the Reeperbahn, a sense that Christianity decimated native cultures at least as effectively as Western venereal diseases did--few are more poignant than the ones that abound in Cook&#39;s own life. This fine work is an adventurous reminder that answers to historical riddles are elusive at best--and seldom as compelling as the myriad new questions they pose. --Jerry McCulley</p><p></p><h2>Sequential Spelling 2</h2><p>This is the only method of teaching spelling that eliminates the Study-for-the-test-and-forget-by- Monday syndrome.

In black images of divinity the author sought a touchstone for transformation, an avenue to the unconscious. In a baroque church in Switzerland she observed the Black Madonna, a virgin painted coal-black who holds a black Christ Child in her arms. In India she discussed women lamas with Tibet's Dalai Lama in exile. Her 1987 trip to Poland turned up another Black Madonna but also exposed her to a different kind of darkness: secret police, racism, Auschwitz. Blending travelogue, free-floating meditation, autobiography and adventure, her intensely personal narrative is a disquieting spiritual odyssey.

Doukas Professor of Modern Greek Literature in the Classics Department at Columbia University. She writes on modern Greek and Greek diaspora literature, and gender and translation theory. Her translations include her edited and co-edited collections: <i>The Rehearsal of Misunderstanding: Three Collections by Contemporary Greek Women Poets</i>; <i>A Century of Greek Poetry</i>; <i>The Scattered Papers of Penelope: New and Selected Poems by Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke</i>, a Lannan Translation selection; and <i>The Greek Poets: Homer to the Present</i>."The poets in [<i>Austerity Measures</i>] are young, most of them under forty, but they inherit a rich Greek tradition of writers who seize a position in public discourse....Poets may need to find new ways to remain attuned to enormous changes that no one can foresee completely. <i>Austerity Measures</i> offers some clues as to what might be carried forward and what might be left behind.&#x201d; &#x2014;David Wallace, <i>The New Yorker</i> Page-Turner<br><br>"Karen Van Dyck&#x2019;s <i>Austerity Measures</i> is a timely trove of new Greek voices that reverberates with urgency and authority, girded with hard-earned truth and a deep seeing necessary for our twenty-first century. Here&#x2019;s a language that goes for the gut and the heart, an earthy sonority. It holds us accountable for what we witness and feel in a time of globalism. This marvelous compendium of lived imagery speaks freely." &#x2014;Yusef Komunyakaa<br><br>"Required reading for&nbsp;poetry&nbsp;fans and those interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;toll of&nbsp;the&nbsp;economic crisis on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Greek people, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;abundant inspiration it is providing for artists and poets in particular." &#x2014;Eleni Sakellis, <i>The National Herald</i><br><br>&#x201c;Greece, caught in a steely grip between Brussels in the north and refugees to the south, has produced a shape-shifting poetry that takes one to the heart of current lived experience. Beside the struggle for escape, the twisting and thrashing, there is a great melancholy too, as yet another generation attends its own funeral.&#x201d; &#x2014;Noonie Minogue, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"Austerity is a self-defeating economic policy which has taken an ugly toll in Greece. The silver lining is that, along with the mass unemployment and the rise of Nazism that it engendered, austerity also occasioned a cultural renaissance. This volume of multilingual poetry is a splendid example: living proof that the Greek crisis is of global significance. It deserves an international audience. Now!" &#x2014;Yanis Varoufakis<br><br>"One of the few benefits of turbulent historical moments is that they tend to give rise to a new cultural efflorescence. Nowhere is this more obvious than in this fascinating anthology, which gathers together a remarkably rich, resourceful range of poetic idioms in response to a common sense of moral and political emergency." &#x2014;Terry Eagleton<br><br>"Karen Van Dyck has collected an extraordinary group of poets and translators who are bound to put Greek poetry on the map again. I&#x2019;ve seen it happen twice in my life: with the Generation of the Thirties that included Cavafy, Seferis, Elytes, and Ritsos, and that reached world recognition; and again, during the Dictatorship of the Colonels, when the group that appeared in the Harvard anthology <i>Eighteen Texts</i> (1972) and others living under censorship earned international recognition with the help of accomplished translators. Now, during another crisis in the country, we find exciting new voices emerging, and I am convinced that they are once again saying something no one else is saying. Call it the knowledge that emerges from the underside of devastation and the creative illumination that comes with tragedy, but something is going on in Greece that we aren&#x2019;t seeing in the news. I give this anthology my strongest support." &#x2014;Edmund Keeley<br><br> "It was no more than two or three poems in before I started to sense the book&#x2019;s atmosphere, to see it as an uncommon chance to share Greek experience beyond the headlines&#x2014;in a way that is fascinating, revelatory and only possible through poetry. Most poems here do not overtly address the crisis. But the collective spirit is new-minted, unmediated and bracing (the quality of translation high)." &#x2014;Kate Kellaway, <i>The Observer</i><br><br>"The light these poets work in, and the language they speak, are still the light and the language of Homer and the great tragedians. <i>Austerity Measures</i>, appearing as Greece faces new difficulties and suffering, offers a newly poignant, imaginative, and resonant body of work. The wonderfully inventive translations reveal a different Greece to English readers: one that does not cancel the past but builds upon it." &#x2014;Ruth Padel</p><h2>Dooku: Jedi Lost (Star Wars)</h2><p><b>Delve into the history of the sinister Count Dooku in the original script to the thrilling&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>audio production!</b><br><br>Darth Tyranus.

Yet the history of immigration to the United States is far different. Even before the xenophobic reaction against European and Asian immigrants in the late nineteenth century, social and economic interest groups worked to manipulate immigration policy to serve their needs. In <i>A Nation by Design</i>, Aristide Zolberg explores American immigration policy from the colonial period to the present, discussing how it has been used as a tool of nation building.</p><p><i>A Nation by Design</i> argues that the engineering of immigration policy has been prevalent since early American history. However, it has gone largely unnoticed since it took place primarily on the local and state levels, owing to constitutional limits on federal power during the slavery era. Zolberg profiles the vacillating currents of opinion on immigration throughout American history, examining separately the roles played by business interests, labor unions, ethnic lobbies, and nativist ideologues in shaping policy. He then examines how three different types of migration--legal migration, illegal migration to fill low-wage jobs, and asylum-seeking--are shaping contemporary arguments over immigration to the United States.</p><p><i>A Nation by Design</i> is a thorough, authoritative account of American immigration history and the political and social factors that brought it about. With rich detail and impeccable scholarship, Zolberg's book shows how America has struggled to shape the immigration process to construct the kind of population it desires.</p></p><p>Aristide R. Zolberg was Walter P. Eberstadt Professor of Political Science and University in Exile Professor, Emeritus, at the New School for Social Research.&#x201c;<i>A Nation by Design</i> is the first comprehensive account of American immigration policy from the colonial period to the present. One of its great strengths is that it places American developments in a cross-national and comparative perspective. Professor Zolberg's breadth of knowledge and the range of his reading are remarkable. The book abounds in fresh insights and interpretations, comprehensiveness and richness of detail. This is a magnum opus.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Fredrickson, Stanford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A Nation by Design</i> is certain to become a standard reference for immigration scholars and a must-read for graduate students in the disciplines-history, political science, and sociology-that produce the bulk of these scholars. It provides a genuinely new perspective on the creation and centrality of immigration policy, and as befits a new point of view, it sketches a landscape with features that have not been visible before.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Alba, State University of New York at Albany</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A Nation by Design</i> is a monumental work by one of America's most distinguished and most historically minded social scientists. No other book on immigration possesses its sweep, nor does any other analyze the history of American immigration policy as comprehensively and insightfully as this one does. For at least a generation, <i>A Nation by Design</i> will become the starting point for anyone seeking to delve into this complex and important subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gary Gerstle, University of Maryland</b><br><br>&#x201c;This beautifully realized and intellectually capacious analytical history moves the story of immigration policy from the side to the center of American political development. Deep, learned, and inventive, <i>A Nation by Design</i> profoundly alters what we know and how we think about demography and identity, membership and law, citizenship and belonging as it crosses the boundaries of disciplines, periods, and ideas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ira Katznelson, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;If you want to understand why the politics of immigration take the form they do, read Aristide R. Zolberg's richly informative book immediately...We now have in our hands a book so thoughtful, so extensively researched, and so balanced in its conclusions that if it does not inform both the current debate and the ones sure to follow, the debate is bound to be poorer even than it already is.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Alan Wolfe</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Aristide Zolberg's <i>A Nation by Design</i>, offers the most comprehensive treatment of US immigration policy ever undertaken and is a major piece of scholarship that will prove indispensable to researchers for years to come. This achievement is no mean feat given the range of historical, political, economic, and sociological analyses of US immigration. What sets Zolberg's treatment apart is its unique historical depth and its realization of the importance of policies and practices other than those officially enacted by Congress--the focus of most earlier historical work on immigration policy...In many ways, immigration is America's never-ending debate. As Zolberg clearly shows, at every point in the history of the nation, from its inception as a dream among idealistic and free-thinking colonists to the present war on terrorism, immigration has figured prominently in debates about who us an American and what it means to be a citizen and resident of the United States. Over the course of US history, attacks on immigrants have waxed and waned, yet in the long run American society has incorporated an ever-widening array of peoples and nationalities into the national franchise. What distinguishes the current wave of anti-immigrant agitation from its predecessors is not its demonizing of foreigners or its harsh treatment of noncitizens, but its clever use of the fear of foreigners to launch a broader assault on the civil liberties not just of immigrants, but of all Americans.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Douglas S.

Homosexuality. Environmentalism. Evolution. Conservative positions on these topics have divided American politics and defined mainstream evangelical Christianity. But what if the strongest arguments against popular evangelical stances on these issues come from evangelical Christianity itself?</b><b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up as an evangelical Christian, Jonathan Dudley was taught that abortion is murder, homosexuality sin, evolution nonsense, and environmentalism a farce. He learned to accept these conclusions--the "big four"--as part of the package deal of Christianity. Yet, when he began studying biology at the evangelical Calvin College and theology at Yale Divinity School, Dudley's views started to change. He soon realized that what he had been told about the Bible--and those four big issues involving scripture and biology--may have been misconstrued and that what so many Christians believe about key social and political issues may be wrong.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguing against absolutism on abortion and opposition to embryonic stem cell research, Dudley shows that most Christian theologians throughout history, including Augustine, Aquinas, and even American evangelicals up until the 1980s, have believed that life does not begin at conception. He argues that evangelical opposition to gay marriage has more to do with allegiance to socially conservative cultural values than allegiance to the Bible. He demonstrates that traditional Christian valuations of science, as well as scientific evidence itself, should lead evangelicals to accept evolution and reject both creationism and intelligent design. And he surveys how evangelicals are changing their minds about environmentalism, and how this development supports a new way of thinking about the Bible. Throughout the book, Dudley, now an M.D. student at The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, also illustrates the scientific problems with popular evangelical views.&nbsp;<br> In the process, he lays the groundwork for a new generation of post-Religious Right evangelical political activists, who believe in evolution, rally behind the environmental movement, are moderate on abortion, and support gay marriage--and who are more faithful to orthodox Christianity than their counterparts.</p><p><b>JONATHAN DUDLEY</b> has appeared on CNN's&nbsp;Newsroom with Kyra Phillips&nbsp;and his writing has been featured on Slate, CNN.com, Salon, The Huffington Post, Religion Dispatches, AlterNet, and the Yale Daily News. He is a graduate of Yale University, holds an M.D. from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and is currently a resident physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital.&nbsp;<i></i><i></i><i></i>"Hands down,&nbsp;<i>Broken Words&nbsp;</i>is the most insightful, clear-eyed, and popularly useful overview to date of why and how Evangelicalism has come to be such a powerful and intractable political and doctrinal bloc in American affairs over the last half century. Written in vivid, conversational style,&nbsp;<i>Words&nbsp;</i>also carries within itself the gentleness of affection and familial courtesy, for Dudley was himself reared evangelical. There is no meanness of spirit here, no clanging of swords. There is simply an urgent demand that we look now and accurately at how politics has led many among us to reversals of our historic faith and practice and, ultimately, to divisive and destructive civil policies and prejudices." -Phyllis Tickle, author of&nbsp;<i>The Great Emergence: How Christianity is Changing and Why</i><br><br>"Jonathan Dudley has rendered a great service with this brilliant book. By taking on the use by social conservatives of both science and scripture to push their agenda with regards to abortion, homosexuality, evolution, and environmentalism, Dudley exposes the inconsistencies and contradictions in their claims as well as their methods of interpretation and arguing. The remarkable aspect of Dudley's book is its astonishing juxtaposition of scientific and religious knowledge and sensibilities. Dudley is equally educated in theology, biblical studies, and biological sciences. The combination is unusual and notable. The writing accessible and elegant." -Dale B. Martin, Woolsey Professor of Religious Studies, Yale University<br><br>"Jonathan Dudley brings theological sophistication, scientific savvy and historical sensitivity to this astute analysis of four central issues in today's culture wars.&nbsp;<i>Broken Words</i>&nbsp;is essential reading for anyone who aspires to reclaim evangelicalism from the Religious Right." -Randall Balmer, John Phillips Professor in Religion, Dartmouth College</p><h2>The Song of Prayer: A Practical Guide to Gregorian Chant</h2><p><p>This is a tried and true beginner&#x2019;s guide to the singing and understanding of Gregorian chant.

In the quietest moments, I liked to imagine ghosts roosting in my studio - from distant figures who may have existed and inspired the legend, to the storytellers, artists, and their creations that have served it. There are rewards in such good company and I feel most privileged to have contributed to a tradition so close to my heart, and served a world of such beauty.....beauty with a serrated edge. Anna Marie FergusonThe legends of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table have inspired some of the greatest works of literature--from Cervantes's Don Quixote to Tennyson's Idylls of the King. Although many versions exist, Malory's stands as the classic rendition. Malory wrote the book while in Newgate Prison during the last three years of his life; it was published some fourteen years later, in 1485, by William Caxton. The tales, steeped in the magic of Merlin, the powerful cords of the chivalric code, and the age-old dramas of love and death, resound across the centuries. <br>The stories of King Arthur, Lancelot, Queen Guenever, and Tristram and Isolde seem astonishingly moving and modern. Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings for brotherhood and community, a love worth dying for, and valor, honor, and chivalry.</p><h2>I Said Yes to Everything: A Memoir</h2><p>Born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal in New York City, actress Lee Grant spent her youth accumulating more experiences than most people have in a lifetime: from student at the famed Neighborhood Playhouse to member of the leg�endary Actors Studio; from celebrated Broadway star to <i>Vogue </i>&#x201c;It Girl.&#x201d; At age twenty-four, she was nominated for an Academy Award for <i>Detective Story</i>, and a year later found herself married and a mother for the first time, her career on the rise.<br><br>And then she lost it all.<br><br>Her name landed on the Hollywood black�list, her offers for film and television roles ground to a halt, and her marriage fell apart.<br><br>Finding reserves of strength she didn&#x2019;t know she had, Grant took action against anti-Communist witch hunts in the arts.

She met a man ten years her junior and began a wild, liberat�ing fling that she never expected would last a lifetime. And after twelve years of fighting the blacklist, she was finally exonerated. With cour�age and style, Grant rebuilt her life on her own terms: first stop, a starring role on <i>Peyton Place</i>, and then leads in <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>, <i>In the Heat of the Night</i>, and <i>Shampoo, </i>for which she won her first Oscar.<br><br>Set amid the New York theater scene of the fifties and the star-studded parties of Malibu in the seventies, <i>I Said Yes to Everything </i>evokes a world of political passion and movie-star glamour. Grant tells endlessly delightful tales of costars and friends such as Warren Beatty, Elizabeth Taylor, Grace Kelly, and Sidney Poitier, and writes with the verve and candor befitting such a seductive and beloved star.</p><p>Lee Grant is an Emmy&#x2013; and Academy Award&#x2013;winning actress and director. In 1989, Women in Film honored Grant with their first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. Grant founded the production company Feury/Grant with her husband and is an adjunct professor at Tisch School of the Arts. She lives in New York City.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected proof***<br><br>Copyright � 2014 Lee Grant<br><br><p><b>OVERTURE</b><br><br></p><p><br>Once, when I was little, I dreamed that I could fly. I dreamed that when I breathed in, I flew upward, weightless, above the heads of all the children in the granite playground. When I breathed in I went up, up, up; when I breathed out I could swoop down and touch the tops of their heads. I swirled gracefully in the air, in my brown winter coat with the velvet collar from De Pinna&#x2019;s. I woke up so excited that I threw off my blanket and ran from my bed to the window in my bedroom. I threw the window open and climbed onto the radiator cover. The birds were flying outside. I would join them. I spread my arms, and from the seventh floor I saw the sparrows swooping toward the concrete below. Suddenly I saw myself smashing beside them. It shocked me, and I was afraid of myself and how easily I could fool myself into disaster.</p><p>I climbed down from the radiator. My mother opened the door. &#x201c;Who opened the window?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold in here.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;ve experienced that sense of exaltation and intensity in my life many times: in adolescence, when the boys made my heart pound; in acting, when I jumped without a net, and ?ew, and turned, and believed for those few hours that I inhabited another&#x2019;s life, and experienced new joy and pain. I&#x2019;ve felt safe in ?ight, in love, in sex, and with those who ?ew with me.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve also jumped and died, not once, but many times, unwisely and impetuously. I flew into fame as a very young Broadway actress, then jumped (through my first husband) into the Communist Party, only to find myself blacklisted for twelve years. I&#x2019;ve reinvented myself many times over, picked up my broken wings and flapped till I could hop around again.</p><p>I&#x2019;m flying again now, in my bedroom, writing, looking out my window. I had no idea, until I began putting pen to paper, that so many memories were inside me waiting to be rediscovered. I&#x2019;m very lucky. I may even come to know myself.<br></p><p><br><b>My Family</b></p><p><br>My mother&#x2019;s job was to mold me into her American Dream.</p><p>Didn&#x2019;t young Witia from Odessa expose the child in her belly to every art museum in New York City, every day that she could carry me on her long legs? The magic of transformation was real in her young life. The Jewish child hunted in her cellar by goyim on horseback was transplanted to a new land where anything was possible, if you made it happen. And she wanted to make it happen for her daughter.</p><p>Witia was determined to plunge her hands into my baby fat and model me into a superior, beautiful being, who would either marry rich or rise above all others in the arts: ballet, theater.</p><p>There was no question about it.<br>My father was born in the Bronx, the youngest son of Polish Orthodox Jewish immigrants. His brother and sisters were ambitious. His brother, Aaron, and sister, Anne, were show business lawyers.</p><p>My father, Abraham, was the good son, the good man. He graduated from Columbia, where he had studied economics with John Dewey and was on the wrestling team. He kept a neat, tight, muscular body all his life. He bent his head over the radio every Saturday afternoon to listen to the Metropolitan Opera. He loved coloraturas. My father was the director of the Young Men&#x2019;s and Young Women&#x2019;s Hebrew Association of the Bronx. It was a position of great responsibility, great dignity. He was the moral compass of the family.</p><p>My grandfather went to shul every day. His tiny wife, Ida, kept an Orthodox home. They lived in a clean, old apartment on College Avenue in the Bronx. Their children must have supported them, because my grandfather never left the shul for his hardware store. But they and America raised smart, goal-oriented children.</p><p>The story goes that my mother went to the Bronx Y to get a job giving classes in dance. She had just graduated from college, where she majored in movement in the Isadora Duncan tradition. I have pictures of her from school. She was beautiful&#x2014;five feet seven, straight back, long shining dark hair, hazel eyes. When she smiled, her top and bottom teeth glistened like a Spanish dancer&#x2019;s.</p><p>She sat in the chair in my father&#x2019;s office, reciting her qualifications for the job. She was rocking in the chair, nonchalant, when she did one rock too many. The chair tipped over and she landed on the floor. My father came from behind his desk, laughing, and helped up my flustered, embarrassed mother. And that. Was that.</p><p>My mother&#x2019;s name was Witia Haskell, Americanized from Vitya Haskelovich. Her mother, Dora, had five children&#x2014;three boys, Joseph, Raymond, and Jack, and two girls, Witia and Fremo. I never knew my grandfather Leon, for whom I was named. He was a clothing designer and a committed Zionist who left for Palestine with several other Zionist men before I was born. He must have done well, because he bought the brownstone on 148th and Riverside Drive before he returned to Palestine to establish a Jewish state.</p><p>They all died of malaria while fighting for their cause. There is a plaque in Rishon LeZion with his name on it. In Russian Leon is Lyov, as in Lyov Tolstoy, Leo Tolstoy. My name is Lyova. There is no such name in Russian. Try being a Lyova in a world of Bettys and Judys and Emilys and Janes.</p><p>Position your tongue for an L, then say yaw, then vah. In high school I changed the V to an R and Lyora, pronounced Leora, was born. Hence Lee.</p><p>From the time I can remember remembering, I was my mother&#x2019;s beloved thing, little girl, petted, brushed, combed, bathed, fed, beautiful, lived through. Her life. Her lovely sweet breath. The light in her hazel eyes.<br>I woke up this morning dreaming about my childhood on 148th Street. I&#x2019;d learned early on from my mother that some of the women in my father&#x2019;s family had made my mother&#x2019;s life so miserable, had criticized her and picked on her so much, that she didn&#x2019;t know where to turn. And her husband, my father, refused to take sides or defend her. The mean women in my father&#x2019;s family, the Rosenthals of Poland, thrived on attack, thrived on gossip. My mother didn&#x2019;t have a chance. There was no mean bitch in her Russian genes. She took me to my grandmother&#x2019;s brownstone on 148th Street to live. I must have been three or even younger when she and my father separated.</p><p>We lived at 620 West 148th Street between Riverside Drive and Broadway until I was six. My mother and I slept on the bird&#x2019;s-eye maple beds in the big bedroom on the second floor, with an ornate white potty underneath. There was no bathroom on the second floor. On the ground floor was the Haskell Nursery School that my mother and her younger sister, Fremo, ran.</p><p>In summer the Haskell Nursery School was a busy, humming place. All the attention wasn&#x2019;t on me. Fifteen or so little children from the neighborhood arrived every morning. One morning, as I opened the door, one of them asked me, &#x201c;Does everyone call you Lovey because they love you so much?&#x201d; A lurch went through me. Is this what love is? A new word, a new concept.</p><p>In warm weather there were games in my grandmother&#x2019;s house with children, painting with Fremo, and being wild and free in the backyard. In winter the children didn&#x2019;t come and I was pushed alone into an empty, cold yard in my ugly orange and brown snowsuit, the first snowsuit on the block, my mother told me. I was bored much of the time. Bored and lonely. I had two ratty baby dolls with cloth bodies that I felt really close to. Their eyes, blue of course, opened and closed.</p><p>I fell inside myself as an only child. Other children were the holy grail&#x2014;I longed for little girls to play with. My Aunt Fremo was a girl- friend. She was a grown child, delightful, peculiar.</p><p>Mostly I was coddled, and bored, and observant. I was participant and audience. I was steered into dance, given books, which I read and read. I listened. To Mother and Fremo. I was sleeping awake, doing what I was told.<br>In winter I climbed up to the window and pressed my forehead to the cold pane. I could see our cement yard with its one big tree in<br>the middle.</p><p>Our house was full. Uncles Joe, who became a lawyer in Great Neck, and Raymond, who worked for the post office, and Jack lived there, Fremo, Grandma, Mother, and me. I was four. My uncles, especially Joe, teased me and played jokes on me. After my bath, when I was naked. They teased me about my behind when I clutched the towel in front of me. When I covered my behind they teased me about my front. They laughed deep men&#x2019;s laughs, especially Uncle Joe.</p><p>My childhood was a waiting period, cocoon-like and plump. I don&#x2019;t remember any strong feelings. I was a not-unwilling lump, but watching carefully.</p><p>I was not allowed to play on the streets with the exciting and exotically normal children. Right next door was the mysterious huge white apartment building 706 Riverside Drive, which contained all the children I longed for. It also contained Mrs. McCarthy and her handsome twenty-year-old son, John.</p><p>My mother allowed me to visit Mrs. McCarthy in her apartment by myself. I would sit on the footstool, looking up at her. She sat in the armchair opposite me. There, with the shades half-drawn, she would pour out her fears and concerns for her son. John was a drinker. Her pale face was crumpled in sadness and worry. Her sad, limp fingers played with a hankie, and she poured her heart out to me. I loved it. I loved Mrs. McCarthy. I loved her for raising me out of the oatmeal plainness of my days. Her stories were moving and thrilling. John was the center, the hero, the villain, the love of her life, lost to her now. Once, the front door opened. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; she said, tightening her hand on my arm. It was midafternoon. A tall, dark-haired young man entered, a little off balance. I remember his head coming down to mine, the gray eyes crinkling, the white smile and pink cheeks. He must have said &#x201c;Hello there&#x201d; and gone off to his room. Mrs. McCarthy&#x2019;s hand was tight on mine. I understood everything.</p><p>Her John reminded me of my Uncle Jack, who lived on the top floor. Jack was younger than John, but also handsome and funny, and he teased me and made me laugh as if I were tickled. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to enter Uncle Jack&#x2019;s room because he had TB, but I would climb to the top of the stairs and run down again. It was our game&#x2014;he sitting in bed on his white sheets cross-legged, me running up to his open door and down the staircase. Jack died when he was twenty-one. I&#x2019;m crying as I write this, thinking of his lonely spirit trapped on the fourth floor. Mother said he was in the sky with the stars. She took me to the window and pointed at the purple sunset. It made no sense to me.</p><p>Mrs. McCarthy gave me a book. It had caricatures and illustrations of human foibles acted out by wonderful, outrageous cats. Men cats in camel hair coats, lady cats dripping with pearls in compromising positions. I got it. The cat book disappeared one day. My mother must have opened the pages. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to visit Mrs. McCarthy anymore.</p><p>I missed Mrs. McCarthy. She trusted me. She didn&#x2019;t treat me like a five-year-old but saw the person I could be. I worried about her for a long time. Maybe it was she who opened me to the fear and pain of others. Maybe it was my uncle.</p><p>My heart aches for us all. The lonely only child; the beautiful immigrant mother responsible in her heart for everyone in our house. Her dreams for me, and her protectiveness, would result in an explosion of rebellion from her only child that almost destroyed her.</p></p><h2>The Happy Atheist</h2><p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an atheist swimming in a sea of superstition, surrounded by well-meaning, good people with whom I share a culture and similar concerns, and there&#x2019;s only one thing I can do. I have to laugh.&#x201d; &#x2014;PZ Myers<br>&nbsp;<br>On his popular science blog,&nbsp;<i>Pharyngula</i>, PZ Myers has entertained millions of readers with his infectious love of evolutionary science and his equally infectious disdain for creationism, biblical literalism, intelligent design theory, and other products of godly illogic. This funny and fearless book collects and expands on some of his most popular writings, giving the religious fanaticism of our times the gleeful disrespect it deserves by skewering the apocalyptic fantasies, magical thinking, hypocrisies, and pseudoscientific theories advanced by religious fundamentalists of all stripes.<br><br>With a healthy appreciation of the absurd, Myers not only pokes fun at the ridiculous tenets of popular religions but also highlights how the persistence of Stone Age superstitions can have dark consequences: interfering with our politics, slowing our scientific progress, and limiting freedom in our culture.<br><br>Forceful and articulate, scathing and funny,&nbsp;<i>The Happy Atheist</i>&nbsp;is a reaffirmation of the revelatory power of humor and the truth-revealing powers of science and reason.</p></p><p><p><b>PZ Myers </b>is a professor of biology at the University of Minnesota, Morris. He was named Humanist of the Year in 2009 by the American Humanist Association and received the International Humanist Award in 2011 from the International Humanist and Ethical Union.

Because changing ideas and new knowledge are sacrilegious.<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout Ken Ham&#x2019;s Creation Museum, in northern Kentucky, a persistent story is exhibited in display after display. Two ways of looking at the world are shown: &#x201c;God&#x2019;s Word,&#x201d; the ultimate source of knowledge, the Bible; and &#x201c;Human Reason.&#x201d; For Christians, human reason is always the fall guy, the error-filled path, while the only truth lies in listening to what God has to say. Christians have an old book with the whole story laid out&#x2014;literally, as the creationists like to claim&#x2014;and by their definition, all observations about the natural world must be accommodated to it. In contrast stands human reason, which dares to contradict the Bible, dares to show great truths not encompassed by the Bible&#x2019;s stories, and most horribly, proposes an alternate, better source of knowledge than a body of ancient myths.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s a major theme throughout the &#x201c;museum,&#x201d; that science defies the word of God, and that the only valid knowledge must be that which is reconcilable with the Bible; Scripture is the sole arbiter of truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>According to the Creation Museum,<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In a biblical worldview, scientific observations are interpreted in light of the truth that is found in the Bible. If conclusions contradict the truth revealed in Scripture, the conclusions are rejected.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>To that mind-set, insisting on the primacy of evidence other than the Bible is heretical&#x2014;a theme at the evangelical Christian creationist organization Answers in Genesis, for instance, is that even the phrase <i>millions of years </i>is a signifier of gross, un-Christian error, since the Bible clearly (doesn&#x2019;t it?) explains that the earth is only six thousand years old.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, you might say, isn&#x2019;t fundamentalist Christianity a kind of pathological religion that carries its antirational claims to absurd extremes? Is it fair to judge faith in general on the basis of this one radical example? Yes. Because fundamentalist Christianity isn&#x2019;t at all unusual. Consider that well-known sixteenth-century theologian Martin Luther. Oh, Luther offers a rich vein of distressing statements opposing rationality.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Reason is the Devil&#x2019;s greatest whore; by nature and manner of being she is a noxious whore; she is a prostitute, the Devil&#x2019;s appointed whore; whore eaten by scab and leprosy who ought to be trodden under foot and destroyed, she and her wisdom. . . . Throw dung in her face to make her ugly. She is and she ought to be drowned in baptism. . . . She would deserve, the wretch, to be banished to the filthiest place in the house, to the closets. Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but&#x2014;more frequently than not&#x2014;struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God.<br>&nbsp;<br>People gave ear to an upstart astrologer [Copernicus] who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon. Whoever wishes to appear clever must devise some new system, which of all systems is of course the very best. This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred scripture tells us [Joshua 10:13] that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Note that last objection: this is not just the opinion of some radical Protestant. The idea was shared with the Catholic Church, which similarly resisted the conclusions of astronomers. Islam also promoted geocentrism, despite the fact that the Koran is said to be without error and contradiction. That&#x2019;s the problem with having a source that is claimed to be infallible but was actually written by people who knew next to nothing about the world around them&#x2014;the stories don&#x2019;t hold up.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unfortunately, the religious strategy for coping with this conflict is not to maintain flexibility and adapt to new information, but instead to restrict new knowledge and condemn it when it contradicts tradition.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the very least, religion&#x2019;s fear of honest information about the world leads to stagnation; at worst, it is destructive to any culture that values scientific advances and the education of its children. Here&#x2019;s a nightmare to contemplate: the staff of Answers in Genesis teaching children about science. And they do! They lead groups of children through recitations condemning evolution and all science that denies the &#x201c;facts&#x201d; of the Bible, sing songs about how the earth is only six thousand years old and the dinosaurs sailed on the Ark with Noah, and teach them how to stump scientists. (It&#x2019;s easy: ask scientists &#x201c;Were you there?&#x201d; and when they say no, you&#x2019;ve demonstrated that they have no evidence to back up their science.)<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m beginning to think that child abuse is a tenet of the Abrahamic religions.<br>&nbsp;<br>So here are some more sacrilegious acts you can commit: Learn something new. Teach something new. Question dogma. Challenge tradition. Laugh at the quaint myths religion offers us.</p></p><h2>Saying It Well: Touching Others with Your Words</h2><p>Bestselling author and master communicator Charles Swindoll has been effectively speaking to others for over fifty years.

When in balance, they animate and empower your life in unique and distinctive ways. This interactive card deck and cutting-edge model for selves-exploration contains 52 Self-cards, 2 wild cards, and an 144-page guidebook. The deck consists of collaged images of the selves, a detailed portrait for each, and multiple draws and spreads tailored for individuals, couples and groups.

Much of this correspondence is published here for the first time, providing an epistolary history of Schneemann and other figures central to the international avant-garde of happenings, Fluxus, performance, and conceptual art. Schneemann corresponded for more than forty years with such figures as the composer James Tenney, the filmmaker Stan Brakhage, the artist Dick Higgins, the dancer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer, the poet Clayton Eshleman, and the psychiatrist Joseph Berke. Her &#x201c;tribe,&#x201d; as she called it, altered the conditions under which art is made and the form in which it is presented, shifting emphasis from the private creation of unique objects to direct engagement with the public in ephemeral performances and in expanded, nontraditional forms of music, film, dance, theater, and literature. <p></p><p>Kristine Stiles selected, edited, annotated, and wrote the introduction to the letters, assembling them so that readers can follow the development of Schneemann&#x2019;s art, thought, and private and public relationships. The correspondence chronicles a history of energy and invention, joy and sorrow, and charged personal and artistic struggles. It sheds light on the internecine aesthetic politics and mundane activities that constitute the exasperating vicissitudes of making art, building an artistic reputation, and negotiating an industry as unpredictable and demanding as the art world in the mid- to late twentieth century.</p></p><p>&#34;Not only a revelatory stroll in Carolee Schneemann&#39;s teeming archive, &#34;Correspondence Course&#34; demonstrates that letters, no less than canvases or installations, are works of art. An exquisitely dense meditation on address, Schneemann&#39;s revelatory letters and Kristine Stiles&#39;s deft critical framing perform a radical reconception of art history itself. At once deeply personal and profoundly philosophical, &#34;Correspondence Course&#34; illuminates and complicates pretty much every notion I have had about the past fifty years of avant-garde art. A brilliant, breathtaking, stunning book.&#34;--Peggy Phelan, Stanford University<p>Kristine Stiles is Professor of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies at Duke University.

Moore and Gillette are the authors of the bestselling King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine.</p><p>Calling itself ``an operator's manual to the psyche'' of men (and a guide to their ``hard-wiring'' for women), this is also a firm if rather theoretical response to critics who charge that men's movement gatherings and exhortations are silly, reactive, and shallow. Moore (Psychology and Religion/Chicago Theological Seminary) and Gillette (a pastoral counselor) write about ``the king within''--a psychological potential that each man apparently carries--with authority and total conviction, discussing the four Jungian archetypes (``King,'' ``Warrior,'' ``Magician,'' ``Lover''), recalling their many representations in ancient and modern cultures, and examining associated patterns of energy that empower men. Readers expecting descriptions of sweat lodges and exotic rites of passage won't find them here. The authors focus on myth and ritual as psychological skills in the quest for the king within, a mature man who strives to achieve creativity and make a positive difference in the world. Although Moore and Gillette acknowledge a variety of failed specimens, from weaklings like-- they say--King Arthur and Jimmy Carter to ``Shadow Kings'' like Caligula and wayward CEOs, they concentrate on identifying positive qualities (caring, courage), on learning how to tap into them, and on empowering others to do the same. To the authors, the urge for power is no shame as long as it's channeled justly. Regrettably, Moore and Gillette rarely refer to contemporary situations and rely on alienating jargon: ``Since the fully manifested King experiences a passionate union with the Anima...Queen, a man can experience the deep Self approaching the Jungian exemplum, but his Self is likely to be asymmetrically masculine.'' For a more accessible, reality-oriented view of similar territory, try Samuel Osherson's Wrestling with Love, reviewed below. (But those attuned to the authors' approach should note that a follow-up title, The Warrior Within, is due out in August.)

He was a gifted poet, architect, painter, writer and textile designer, who also founded the Kelmscott Press, the most famous of the Arts and Crafts private presses. Morris&#39; ideas later came to influence numerous artists and craftspeople who sought to negotiate a viable place within the modern world in the troubled years that followed the First World War. His ideals inspired designers, including those who contributed to the 1951 Festival of Britain, with a direct sense of mission to bring the highest design standards within the reach of everyone. This collection of quotations by Morris, his friends, associates and those who came after, including Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw, among others, reveals and explores his passionately held view that beautiful, functional design should be accessible to all.</p><p></p><h2>Mr. Wu &amp; Mrs. Stitch: The Letters of Evelyn Waugh &amp; Diana Cooper</h2><p>Tells the story, via the letters that the two characters wrote to each other, of the relationship between Evelyn Waugh, author of &#34;Brideshead Revisited&#34;, and Lady Diana Cooper, actress and hostess. The two endearments of Mr Wu and Mrs Stitch were used in the correspondence for over 30 years. His letters had originally thought to be lost until 20 years after his death in 1966 they surfaced in somewhat mysterious circumstances. When the correspondence opens he was 20 and she was not quite 40. He was restless and impatient. She was a daughter of the eight Duke of Rutland, an actress who married a rising politician, Duff Cooper. The editor of these letters is the granddaughter of Lady Diana Cooper and she argues that the correspondents demanded the best from each other and that neither were afraid of expressing their opinions and feelings. Other books by this writer include &#34;Cairo in the War, 1939-45&#34;, &#34;The Diana Cooper Scrapbook&#34; and &#34;A Durable Fire: The Letters of Duff and Diana Cooper&#34;.</p><p>Artemis Cooper is the author of a number of books including Cairo in the War, 1939-1945, Writing at the Kitchen Table, the authorized biography of Elizabeth David and, most recently, Patrick Leigh Fermor: An Adventure.

A chance viewing of an "adult" film called Throat Sprockets transforms his notion of sexuality and, thereby, his identity. From then on his life revolves around this elusive film, his desire to see it again and his lust to share in the passions it records. The narrator's obsession (which may be guessed at from the book's title) is not one that the average reader is likely to share, but first novelist Lucas has more in mind here. The larger issue is the power of film, and it is explored amidst frequently striking images and turns of phrase. Though he is limited to words in describing what is primarily a visual experience, Lucas's implicit proposition-that a director could willfully manipulate his audience to a dire degree-is successfully and somewhat frighteningly supported by the unfolding drama of this novel. The narrator accuses: "What had been done to me [by the film] had been no accident. It had been nothing less than a conscious and deliberate act of terrorism"; and he is not the lone victim. Lucas allows parody to intrude when he depicts the spreading "sprocketing" subculture as the subject of an inflammatory talk show. Rare slips aside, Lucas has created a grippingly twisted tale of a mind and soul ensnared. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oriental Vegetables: The Complete Guide for the Gardening Cook</h2><p>Increasingly, chefs today both professional and amateur are emphasizing fresh, seasonal ingredients, locally and organically grown. Now, in the revised edition of the book Alice Waters of Chez Panisse called indispensable, Joy Larcom presents abundant information about crops that are full of flavor, highly nutritious and easy to grow. She describes over seventy exotic vegetables that can be cultivated regardless of climate, soil type or garden size. Here are hardy leafy mustards, komatsuna, Chinese yams and cabbage, lablab beans, pak choi, the climbing spinach basella, gourds, luffas and many more. For this edition, Larkcom has added new varieties and taken out those which are no longer available. She&#39;s updated information on such topics as pest and disease control; and added to the section that offers over 50 recipes for making delicious salads (Chinese Hot Salad), salad dressings (Lemon and Green Onion Dressing), soups (Basic Western Style Greens Soup), pickles (Pickled Mushroom Stems), and other dishes using the vegetables featured in the first section (Azuki Bean Risotto with Watercress and Grilled Tofu, Creamy Artichoke Soup, Duck with Mustard Leaves and Pasta, etc.). The helpful appendices include a glossary of gardening terms, a season/month conversion chart, a growing information chart, plant names, gardening organizations and seed suppliers in the U.S.</p><p><br>JOY LARKCOM is the author of <em>The Salad Garden: Salad from Seed to Table</em>, and is a pioneer in organic gardening. She was awarded the Royal Horicultural Societys Veitch Memorial Medal for her work on Oriental vegetables.<br>Larkcom, a British-based gardener and author of The Salad Garden ( LJ 5/1/84), presents a comprehensive volume on Chinese and Japanese vegetables. Over 100 varieties are listed with information on scientific and Oriental names, general background, cultivation requirements, and use in the kitchen. An additional section focuses on gardening techniques, such as "cut and come again" methods and protected cropping. The book concludes with a short collection of simple recipes. The information-dense text is occasionally lightened by high-quality line drawings and several pages of color photographs. The thorough index will be helpful for individuals interested in determining the identity of vegetables found in Oriental markets. As a whole, Oriental Vegetables focuses more on information for the "garden" than the "kitchen," and it should be a fine addition for most gardening collections, especially in such areas where interest in Oriental food is high.<br><i>- Virginia A.

Vanessa Benjamin carries forth Blackstone&#39;s tradition of matching the gender of the narrator to the author, rather than to the main character. When the genders of hero and narrator don&#39;t match, one gets a more old-fashioned sense of being read to, rather than hearing a performance. Benjamin relies strictly on the drama inherent in the text, subtly underscoring it with pacing and emphasis. Her minimalistic vocal shifts when reading dialogue are initially distracting, but they quickly fade into the background, as she means them to do. S.F.

This guide helps travelers design custom trips, depending on the time and interests they have.<br> &nbsp;<br> The parks are grouped region by region so that vacationers can plan trips to one or more central location. Each chapter is introduced by a map and a geographical profile, followed by the parks in alphabetical order. Individual parks start with a portrait of the natural wonders available, their history, and the ecological setting and stresses they face. A practical "How to Get There" follows with suggestions on when best to visit and a "How to Visit" section with advice on which activities to engage in, how much time to provide for each, and how to savor the beauty of the place. After the descriptions, each park has an "Information &amp; Activities" page with detailed visitor information, including the location of the visitor centers, the fees, pet guidance, special advisories, camping, and lodging details. Suggested brief, nearby excursions are provided to encourage the traveler to explore beyond the park boundaries.<br> &nbsp;<br> This update includes the lastest information on the 2009 Tsunami which devistated America Samoa National Park, information on road changes that resulted from the recent flooding in Olympic National Park, and changes in Arches National Park, including the collapse of Wall Arch in late 2008. The new edition also has 200 new photos by noted nature photographer Phil Schermeister. These pictures, many of which have never been published before, reflect the beauty and grandeur of our national treasures, while the accompanying text, written by experienced National Geographic writers who have traveled the parks, is full of personal, useful, and practical information.</p><p>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC is one of the world&#x2019;s leading nonfiction publishers, proudly supporting the work of scientists, explorers, photographers, and authors, as well as publishing a diverse list of books that celebrate the world and all that is in it.

For more than an hour she has shown them the living wonders around them&#x2014;butterflies and snails, alligators and fish, and bird after bird. Near the end of the walk, she gathers the visitors around her. She points to a string of nine white ibis coursing a cloudless sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Imagine seeing ibis in the 1930s,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That would have been a flight of about 90 birds. We are seeing only about 10 percent of the wading birds that were here then. When you get home, write your congressmen and tell them we have to save Everglades.&#x201d; Though park staff may not lobby Congress, in this threatened national park, lobbying happens on nature walks and appears in official literature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everglades National Park is at the southern tip of the everglades in Florida, a hundred-mile-long subtropical wilderness of saw- grass prairie, junglelike hammock, and mangrove swamp, that originally ran from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Water, essential to the survival of this ecosystem, once flowed south from the lake unhindered. But as the buildup of southern Florida has intensified, canals, levees, and dikes have increasingly diverted the water to land developments and agribusinesses. Vast irrigated farmlands have spread to the park&#x2019;s gates. The waning of the ibis carries a warning: Watery habitats in the park are shrinking because not enough water is getting to Everglades.<br> &nbsp;<br> The park&#x2019;s special mission inspires the crusade to save it. Unlike early parks established to protect scenery, Everglades was created to preserve a portion of this vast ecosystem as a wildlife habitat. The park&#x2019;s unique mix of tropical and temperate plants and animals&#x2014; including more than 700 plant and 300 bird species, as well as the endangered manatee, threatened crocodile, and Florida panther&#x2014; has prompted UNESCO to grant it international biosphere reserve status as well as World Heritage site designation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everglades environmentalists and crusaders urge the purchase of privately owned wetlands east and north of the park. This would further protect the ecosystem and give the park a larger claim to the water that Everglades shares with its thirsty neighbors.<br> &nbsp;<br> The diverse life of Everglades National Park, from algae to alligators, depends upon a rhythm of abundance and drought. In the wet season, a river inches deep and miles wide flows, almost invisibly, to the Gulf of Mexico. In the dry season, the park rests, awaiting the water&#x2019;s return. The plants and animals are a part of this rhythm. When humans change it, they put Ever- glades life at risk.<br> &nbsp;<br> How to Get There<br> South from Miami, take us 1&#x2014; Florida&#x2019;s Turnpike to Florida City, then go west on Fla. 9336 (Palm Dr.) to the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, about 50 miles from Miami. West from Miami, take us 41 (the Tamiami Trail) to Shark Valley Visitor Center. From Naples, head east on us 41 to Fla. 29, then south to Everglades City. Airports: Miami and Naples.<br> &nbsp;<br> When to Go<br> Everglades has two seasons: dry (mid-December through mid-April) and wet (the rest of the year). The park schedules most of its activities in the dry season; hot, humid weather and clouds of mosquitoes make park visitors quite uncomfortable during the wet season.<br> &nbsp;<br> How to Visit<br> If you can stay only a day for a drive-in visit, get out of your car and learn about Everglades ecology by taking self-guided walks at road turnoffs on the drive from the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center to Flamingo. For a longer stay, pick either Flamingo or Everglades City as your base and time your travels to the schedules of con- cession boat tours. In wet or dry sea- son, only a boat or canoe gives you access to the backcountry. Because of mosquitoes, the dry season is best for canoeing. (Near park entrances you&#x2019;ll see signs advertising airboat rides; airboats, which can disturb wildlife and tear up saw grass, are not licensed to operate in the park.)</p><h2>Obadiah (Anchor Bible)</h2><p>Provides a translation and commentary drawn from analysis of the book&#39;s grammar and philology, literary forms and context, religious and social situation, and historical context</p><p>Paul R.

But the terrible truth is that much of the bombing was carried out against the expressed demands of the Allied military leadership, leading to the needless deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.<br><br> Focusing on the crucial period from 1942 to 1945, <i>Fire and Fury</i> tells the story of the American and British bombing campaign through the eyes of those involved: the military and civilian command in America, Britain, and Germany, the aircrews in the skies who carried out their orders, and civilians on the ground who felt the fury of the Allied attacks.<br><br> Here, for the first time, the story of the American and British air campaigns is told�&#x2014;and the cost accounted for.</p><p><b>Randall Hansen</b> is a Professor of Politics and holds a Research Chair at the University of Toronto.<b>PREFACE</b><br><br>In late August 2007, all hell broke loose. The Canadian War Museum announced that, in response to pressure from veterans&#x2019; groups, it was going to alter a plaque describing actions of Bomber Command during the Second World War. The plaque, drafted by Museum officials, had read:<br><br><b>The value and morality of the strategic bomber offensive against Germany remains bitterly contested. Bomber Command&#x2019;s aim was to crush civilian morale and force Germany to surrender by destroying its cities and industrial installations. Although Bomber Command and American attacks left 600,000 Germans dead and more than five million homeless, the raids resulted in only small reductions in German war production until late in the war.</b><br><br>In altering the plaque, the Museum did what it swore it would never do: rewrite history in the face of public pressure. And, in doing so, it unleashed a fury of controversy. Some observers condemned the decision as craven, revisionist, and even Orwellian. Others responded with equal force, accusing the Museum&#x2019;s critics of arrogance, insensitivity to the veterans, and a lack of patriotism. Hate mail filled inboxes, and the bloggers were active for weeks. The redrafted text, three times as long as the original, satisfied the veterans and their supporters, but did so at the expense of obscuring the history that the original was meant to explain.<br><br>These events provoked such strong feelings because the history of Bomber Command is Canadian history. During the Second World War, forty thousand Canadians served in Bomber Command, making this country by far the second-largest contributor to the British bombing campaign. One-quarter of these Canadians, ten thousand young men, lost their lives. Throughout the war, Canadians permeated the Royal Air Force (RAF). They served as individual volunteers in RAF squadrons, from 1940 as distinct Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) squadrons serving in the RAF&#x2019;s five operational groups, and from 1943 as a distinct operational group (6 Group) made up solely of RCAF squadrons and paid for by the Canadian government. By the end of the war, Canadians comprised some 25 percent of Bomber Command&#x2019;s operational aircrew. While Canadians were also found in other parts of the RAF, 80 percent of the fifty thousand RCAF graduates who served overseas were in Bomber Command.<br><br>The controversy over the Canadian War Museum&#x2019;s decision &#x2013; and, more importantly, the history behind it &#x2013; is a window into questions that matter today. How can we judge the role that bombing played in the Allied victory? What role does morality play in the execution and evaluation of war? Does it make sense to apply today&#x2019;s moral standards to decisions taken in wartime? Joseph Goebbels famously said that &#x201c;we all end up as the greatest heroes or the greatest war criminals.&#x201d; History, in other words, is written by the winners. How can we ensure, for this generation and subsequent ones, that Goebbels is not proved right retrospectively?<br><br>The debate on the bombing war has carried on, with pauses, for decades, and it will continue. All authors would like to believe that their argument will be the last word on their topic of choice, but they know &#x2013; or should know &#x2013; that it won&#x2019;t be. As that debate rolls on, it is important to bear in mind that an evaluation of the effects and the morality of the Canadian, British, and American bombing war can cast no aspersions on the bravery or sincerity of the young men who chose to serve in Bomber Command, still less on the memory of ten thousand Canadians who died over Europe. It is to their bravery and that of tens of thousands of others in the army and the navy that we owe our ability to debate these issues free from intellectual and political tyranny.<br><i>1889</i><br>Hitler is born<br>Nietzsche goes mad<br><br><i>1918</i><br>Hitler weeps in an uncontrollable rage<br>The Royal Air Force is formed<br>1943<br><br>1.The day Hamburg died<br><i>July 27, 1943</i><br><br>At 4:30 p.m., a young boy, Ernst-G�nther Haberland, was playing in a bleak courtyard. His mother came to fetch him; they were going to the air-raid shelter early. She collected the family&#x2019;s most important documents, dressed herself and her son in as many clothes as they could wear, and put a rucksack on his back. Her husband was at work and she could not get word to him. They left their flat at G�tenstrasse, 55 at 5 p.m. and headed to the Berliner Tor (the Berlin Gate), just a few blocks north.<br><br>Their neighbourhood was Hammerbrook, a working-class district about two miles southeast of the city centre. The architecture was characteristic of turn-of-the-century Germany. Most buildings were blocks of four- or five-storey houses. The apartments at the front of these houses were populated by the relatively affluent. The flats at the back were dark and small. They housed the poor. Some eighteen families lived in each house. Between 1928 and 1932, unemployment in the neighbourhood had more than quadrupled.<br><br>Ernst-G�nther and his mother needed to get to the air-raid shelter at the Berliner Tor. The building, called a <i>Winkel</i> (tower shelter), had been built in 1939. It was a multi-storey bunker with curved outer walls and a peaked, oval roof. Many air-raid shelters were made of solid concrete and looked like massive rectangle blocks, but the one at Berliner Tor was covered in brick. It was almost attractive. There were two large main doors made of steel, with steps leading up to them. From outside, it looked like a windmill without the sails. The outer walls were just over three feet thick at the base (and about half that near the apex); the roof was nine feet thick. Inside, the shelter&#x2019;s services &#x2013; heating and electricity, toilets, running drinking water, and ventilation &#x2013; were all contained in a central column-like structure. Between the column and the outer walls were rows of wide, backless benches just a few feet apart. A spiral staircase led down to a deep basement and the floors below. In all, some six hundred people could fit into the bunker, but it was always far too full.<br><br>Ernst-G�nther and his mother took their places. The majority of people there were women, children, and old men. Each shelter had an air-raid warden, often Wehrmacht soldiers, members of the SS, or Hitler Youth who had sought safety from the bombs. Most of the other young men were away fighting at the front. Soon, all the benches were taken and the aisles were also full of people standing. Sometime after 8 p.m., there were around one thousand people inside and the massive steel door was closed and sealed. Latecomers hoping to enter were left standing on the steps.<br>Inside, it was horribly uncomfortable. People had barely any room to move. They made stilted conversation. The atmosphere was hot and stale, and everyone was overdressed. They were allowed only one bag in the shelter, so they wore layers of garments. Those who had not drunk enough liquid soon felt desperately thirsty; those who had drunk too much were in need of the toilet. No one dared give up their seat, knowing it would not be there when they returned.<br><br>As Ernst-G�nther and his mother made their way to the bunker, a thirteen-year-old girl, Elfriede Bock, was at home with her family. Like Ernst-G�nther, Elfriede was a native of Hammerbrook. She was raised by a harsh mother and a distant father who made it clear to her that he had wanted a son. &#x201c;I had no idea,&#x201d; she said sixty years later, &#x201c;that women could have any value.&#x201d; The Nazis told her they could, and did: as mothers, they were Germany&#x2019;s future.<br><br>Elfriede&#x2019;s father came home at 5 p.m., earlier than expected. He ordered his wife and daughter to pack their things and get ready to go to the shelter. Elfriede&#x2019;s mother looked startled, and in her strong Hamburg accent she said, &#x201c;Why? It sounds like we will never come back to this apartment again.&#x201d; Elfriede&#x2019;s father barked, &#x201c;Just do what I say and be quick about it.&#x201d;<br><br>Elfriede and her mother left the apartment at 8 p.m., stepped out onto the S�derstrasse, turned right toward the Berliner Tor, and followed the path taken by Ernst-G�nther and his mother a few hours earlier. Elfriede was lightly clothed and carried a cardigan. Everything else was in her suitcase in the basement of the house. At Heidenkampsweg, the street showed the scars of stray bombs that had fallen two nights earlier. City workers were clearing the sidewalks and climbing ladders to inspect the roofs for damage. The air was dusty, hot, and stifling.<br><br>Outside the shelter, they met Elfriede&#x2019;s friend Kuttl and went in together. Elfriede had hoped they could secure a good spot, but the shelter was already full, and all of the benches were taken. People were pushing past them looking for a place to sit. Elfriede heard a group of women nearby frantically chatting. They spoke of a raid on Hamburg two days earlier, of a thousand planes over the city, fifteen hundred bodies, and tens of thousands fleeing the city. Elfriede viewed such reports as nonsense, though she wondered about the fifteen hundred bodies. She thought, <i>It must have been horrible to be trapped in a cellar for three hours. But so many airplanes? Almost a thousand? Impossible. The Allies couldn&#x2019;t have so many. No fear! &#x201c;Men, hold tight, the F�hrer will get you out!&#x201d; </i>(Jungs, haltet aus, der F�hrer haut euch raus!) <i>That&#x2019;s the message he sent to the soldiers in Stalingrad. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If only these women would shut �up.</i><br><br>They would. At 12:41 a.m., the first alarm rang out over the city, followed by a second at 12:50 a.m. Elfriede heard the bombers fly over, seemingly toward Berlin in the southeast. The airplanes soon turned, though, and the roar grew louder. The wishful belief that the city would be spared lasted only a few seconds. The bombers turned toward southwest Hamburg.<br>At 8 p.m., as Elfriede was leaving her apartment for the bunker, a boy from an even poorer background, Werner Wendland, was finishing a swim with three friends in the canal. It was close to the river and a favourite spot for working-class boys from the neighbourhood. The streets were hot and dusty, and the three of them walked back laughing, shoving each other and thinking about supper. Back on his street, Stresowstrasse, Werner saw people with backpacks heading toward the bunker, pushing bicycles overloaded with belongings. He asked them what they were doing. &#x201c;There will be a huge air-raid tonight,&#x201d; came the response. The boys laughed it off. Until then, every large attack had been followed by a period of calm or nothing more than nuisance raids.<br><br>Werner returned home and told his parents the story. They decided to wait and see how the night would unfold. When the first air-raid warning rang out over the city, his father told Werner to go to the shelter, promising to join him afterwards. Ten minutes later, Werner, his mother, and his sister joined a neighbour and her daughter. They guessed that the Berliner Tor bunker would be full and went instead to a smaller shelter down the street. An hour later, Werner&#x2019;s father had still not arrived. Following a tip given by his neighbours, Werner went to the nearby air-raid bunker. It was so full that there was no chance of pushing past the crowds to reach his father. Just then, the roar of planes above became louder, and he saw the marker flares gliding down against the night sky. Werner thought, <i>If this gets worse, my mother and sister will need my help more than my father.</i> He headed back to the shelter.<br><br>He had barely arrived when the first bombs exploded. The floor of the cellar heaved and then fell. The walls cracked. Dust filled the air. Water spurted out of cracked pipes. People moaned and sometimes cried out. Others prayed. Werner thought about his father.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Complete Illustrated Book Of The Psychic Sciences</h2><p>Outlines the history and practices of seventeen mystic sciences from astrology to telepathy and yoga</p><p></p><h2>As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth</h2><p>Appears unread. No remainder marks or price clippings. 249 pages. Illustrated. No writing or tears. Tight spine, clean pages.</p><p>Gilbreth is perhaps best known as the mother of 12 from her affectionate, often humorous portrait of family life in Cheaper by the Dozen (1948). In addition to raising a large family, she had a long, successful professional career in pioneering motion studies and industrial psychology. She earned a doctorate and collaborated with her husband, Frank Gilbreth, until his sudden death in 1924. In this autobiography, begun in 1941 after her husband's death, she describes her childhood and her early work and family life. Regrettably, the autobiography stops in 1941, more than 30 years before she died. In those later years, she continued on her own to publish books, lecture at colleges, work on presidential commissions, and amass a collection of honorary degrees and awards. There is not yet a full-length biography of Lillian Gilbreth, but this autobiography offers insights into the personal and professional life of a remarkably successful woman.

Indeed, in seeking to transform the discarded scraps and residues of everyday life, the technique found extraordinary new opportunities for subversive rupture, playful artifice, and surreal juxtaposition, together with a completely new conception of the work of art as a material thing. Collage quickly became essential to the idea of the modern, leaving its mark on almost every art movement since, from Dada and Constructivism, via Surrealism, Pop, and Situationism, to the digital techniques of today.<br><br> This book, the first comprehensive survey of the technique, explores in full the theoretical implications and political messages behind the work of the past century, explaining how the process was intimately linked to other revolutions in art practice. It covers the many offshoots of collage, including assemblage, montage, photomontage, and decollage. Along the way it outlines a new vision of modern art springing from this most simple and democratic of techniques. 206 illustrations, 91 in color.</p><p>Brandon Taylor is Professor in the History of Art, University of Southampton.

Danusha Goska, an Indiana activist with a paralyzing physical disability, writes about overcoming political immobilization, drawing on her history with the Peace Corps and Mother Teresa. Vaclav Havel, the former president of the Czech Republic, finds value in seemingly doomed or futile actions taken by oppressed peoples. Rosemarie Freeney Harding recalls the music that sustained the civil rights movement, and Paxus Calta-Star recounts the powerful vignette of an 18-year-old who launched the overthrow of Bulgaria's dictatorship. Many of the essays are new, others classic works that continue to inspire. Together, these writers explore a path of heartfelt community involvement that leads beyond despair to compassion and hope. The voices collected in <i>The Impossible Will Take a Little While</i> will help keep us all working for a better world despite the obstacles.</p><p>Everywhere I go in the country, people ask me if their efforts can really matter. I wrote this book to give people hope&#x2014;drawing together some of the finest engaged writers in the world to explore what keeps us going in difficult times. <p>People say the book will be tremendously helpful for helping ordinary citizens replenish the wellsprings of their commitment and keep working for justice in this hard political time. </p><p>I've included pieces that explore the historical, political, ecological and theological frameworks that help us to persist&#x2014;with concrete examples of how people have faced and overcome despair. Some directly address our current politics. Others examine how people persisted in the struggles of the past: what it was like to confront South African apartheid, Eastern Europe&#x2019;s Communist dictatorships, or Mississippi's entrenched segregation. </p><p>Political hope and personal hope are intertwined, of course. What lets us work for change is related to what keeps us going day after day when our personal lives get difficult. So some pieces straddle both. But I&#x2019;ve focused on the kind of hope that takes us beyond merely personally surviving and carving out the best private life we can. I believe The Impossible Will Take a Little While can help readers find common solutions and see the world clear-eyed&#x2014;acknowledging the destructive power of greed, fear, and shortsighted expedience, resisting the temptations of complacency and sentimentality, yet continuing nonetheless, to work for change, remembering that hope, in the words of one of my authors, is acting in spite of the evidence, then watching the evidence change. </p><p>I think you&#x2019;ll enjoy the book</p><b>Paul Rogat Loeb</b> is the author of <i>Soul of a Citizen</i> and three other books.

Next door live retired lawyer Judge Harper, his sour-faced wife, and their overindulged attorney son James. Two married daughters also live nearby. Judge Harper's sister Mary is expected home any day from her missionary work in China, where the Boxer Rebellion is making her work dangerous. But not as dangerous, it seems, as life in South Bend, where it's Hildas fate to discover Mary Harper's strangled body while strolling in the park with her policeman boyfriend Patrick. Unimpressed by the efforts of the local police and haunted by nightmares, Hilda, with help from housemaid Norah, begins to investigate on her own, evading the eagle eye of Williams the butler. The drowning death of the Harpers's Polish maid Wanda, a few days later, adds urgency to Hilda's task. The police seem to regard Mr. Kee Long, a visitor from China, as their chief suspect, in the face of a solid alibi. Hilda comes to his rescue, eventually uncovering the murder motive and the close- to-home killer. This maiden outing for straight-arrow, gutsy, and highly likable Hilda is sure to please fans of the author's Dorothy Martin series (Malice in Miniature, 1998, etc.). -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Third Edition has over 1,700 footnotes explaing Hebrew idioms, Jewish customs, giving meanings to Hebrew names, and expanding meanings that are hidden in Greek grammar and words. The Glossary has seventy pages that bring greater understanding to the text and to first century Jewish teachings.</p><p>&#34;A magnificent work! The only New Testament I&#39;ve used since I got it.&#34; by Sid Roth, President of Messianic Vision. &#34;A translation that everyone should have.&#34; by Pastor Karl Strader, Carpenter&#39;s Home Church, Lakeland, Fla. Readers&#39; Comments: &#34;Thanks for sending The Power New Testament. What a blessing.&#34; &#34;The Glossary is so interesting I could spend all my time there.&#34; &#34;The footnotes bring such meaning to verses I had previously read many times.&#34;Mark 11:23. Truly I say to you that whoever would say to this mountain, 'You must immediately be removed and you must immediately be cast into the sea,' and would not doubt in his heart but would believe that what he is saying is happening, it shall be to him. 24. Because of this I say to you, you must continually pray for everything, then for whatever you are asking, believe that you will take it, and it will be there for you. <p>Mark 5:25. And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years 26. and suffered much under many physicians and spent everything beyond her means and was not helped but rather became worse, 27. when she heard about Jesus, as she came from behind the crowd she touched the fringe of His prayer shawl: 28. for she was saying that "If I could just touch His prayer shawl I will be saved." 29. And immediately the flow of her blood dried and she knew that her body was healed from the plague. </p><p>Acts 4:31. And after they made supplication, the place in which they were gathering was shaken, and they were all saturated with the Holy Spirit and they were speaking the Word of God with boldness. </p><p>1 Cor 10:13. A trial has not taken you except what is common to mankind: but God is faithful, Who will not permit you to be tested beyond what you are able, and therefore He will then in the test make you able to patiently bear the way out. </p><p>Glossary "...Prayer shawl making required Rabbinic training which Paul, Priscilla, and Aquila had. (Acts 18:2,3) The Greek word skenopoioi, translated prayer shawl makers or tent makers, is not found anywhere else in Scripture or secular Greek writing. Perhaps Luke coined the word or possibly skenopoioi was used by Jewish people when speaking of making prayer shawls. Jewish men referred to the prayer shawl as a tent or prayer closet because it was placed over the head to shield the eyes while praying....."</p></p><h2>Yacht Design Explained: A Boat Owner&#39;s Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design</h2><p><p><strong>At last, sailboat design explained in a way that <em>all</em> boat owners can understand and put to use.</strong></p> The first guide to design aimed at <em>every</em> sailor, <em>Yacht Design Explained</em> uses state-of-the-art graphics, dynamic charts and photographs, and clear explanations to show what makes hulls, keels, ballast, rudders, foils, masts, and sails work. It reveals why certain designs perform well and others fail.<br><br> The authors examine a range of boats, from a 14-foot dinghy to a 40-foot cruiser, from a catamaran to an offshore singlehander. They break through the often confusing physics of yacht design to provide an understanding that sailors can use to get the most out of their time afloat.

(Popular Culture and Philosophy, 19)</h2><p>From the 1970s cult TV show, <i>Monty Python&#x2019;s Flying Circus,</i> to the current hit musical <i>Spamalot,</i> the Monty Python comedy troupe has been at the center of popular culture and entertainment. The Pythons John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam are increasingly recognized and honored for their creativity and enduring influence in the worlds of comedy and film. <i>Monty Python and Philosophy</i> extends that recognition into the world of philosophy. Fifteen experts in topics like mythology, Buddhism, feminism, logic, ethics, and the philosophy of science bring their expertise to bear on Python movies such as <i>Monty Python&#x2019;s Life of Brian</i> and Flying Circus mainstays such as the Argument Clinic, the Dead Parrot Sketch, and, of course, the Bruces, the Pythons&#x2019; demented, song-filled vision of an Australian philosophy department. <i>Monty Python and Philosophy</i> follows the same hit format as the other titles in this popular series and explains all the philosophical concepts discussed in laymen&#x2019;s terms.</p><p></p><h2>Valley of the Golden Mummies</h2><p>An exploration, highlighted by hundreds of colorful photographs, of an incredible archaeological find in Egypt, from the excavation's director, discusses the hundreds of mummies, many wearing gold masks, that have been found and explains the find's historical significance. 22,000 first printing. History, QPB, &amp; Natural Science Main. BOMC.</p><p>In the winter of 1996, a guard at the temple of Alexander the Great near Bahariya, Egypt, reported an astounding discovery: during a routine patrol, he had been startled when the donkey he had been riding fell into a hole. Helping the donkey out of its predicament, the guard saw that the hole was in fact an opening into a tomb--and one from which a mummy's golden face peered.<p> Zahi Hawass, the director general of the Giza Pyramid complex and a leading Egyptian archaeologist, hurried to the site, which turned up more and more of those golden-masked corpses--105 in the first year of excavation alone, the largest number of mummies yet discovered at a single Egyptian site. Hawass's book describes the site and its contents, which offer material evidence of daily life at the Bahariya Oasis during the 25th and 26th dynasties, a time about which little is now known. Gaps in the historical record are quickly being filled, however, thanks to Hawass's ongoing findings, only a fraction of which are reported in his book. He guesses that the Valley of the Golden Mummies may eventually yield more than 10,000 perfectly preserved corpses and a wealth of information about their time.</p><p> The richly illustrated text also provides a detailed account of the work of modern Egyptologists, who accord their subjects a respect not often shown by earlier generations of field workers; as Hawass remarks, "We always treat a mummy as if it were still a person, just as we would hope to be treated ourselves in similar circumstances." It's an altogether fascinating excursion into long-ago times. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>ZAHI HAWASS, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo, received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and has been excavating in Egypt for over thirty years.

A house with a yard. The younger one, four, likes to fold her body over the seat of her swing, observe the world from upside down. She circles her feet, twists the pair of steel ropes until they&#x2019;re all the way wound. She kicks up her legs. The swing spins. She likes the sensation of dizziness.</p><p>The older one, eleven, in the kitchen, chops ginger and scallions, puts on the rice. Sets out a small plate of pickled radishes.</p><p>It is early morning. Their mother is still asleep. On Mondays and Thursdays she attends night classes at the local college. On Fridays she works at the accounting office until late. &#x201c;One more year,&#x201d; she has said, though she has promised this before. She has come a long way since her husband died and she was forced to come alone to America. The mother will soon sit for another actuarial exam. &#x201c;An excellent profession,&#x201d; she tells the girls with pride. They know only that it involves a lot of math.</p><p>The older one sits at the kitchen table. Opens her tin pan of watercolors, paints with quick, smooth strokes. She will try a still life today, that bowl of peaches, or a vase of Shasta daisies fresh-picked from the garden. She likes the feeling of focus. When the rest of the world falls away.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Jie!</i> Come look!&#x201d; her sister calls from outside.</p><p>The older one doesn&#x2019;t look up.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here, I found something!&#x201d;</p><p>She sets down her brush, heads out to the yard. The screen door slams shut behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you see it, Jie? There.&#x201d;</p><p>In the corner, by the fence. Wet grass tickles her feet. The younger one points to something in the low branches of the dogwood tree.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a spider web, Mei-mei. See how its threads stretch from this branch to that one?&#x201d;</p><p>It is their first summer in New Jersey. Their first house with a yard. Before, they lived in Third Uncle&#x2019;s basement, in Tennessee.</p><p>The younger one&#x2019;s eyes, wide.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Mei. You don&#x2019;t have to be scared. Spiders won&#x2019;t hurt you. They catch flies and mosquitoes and all kinds of other insects. See the web? The spider spins it with a silk from its body. It&#x2019;s sticky. The bug gets caught in those strands and the spider eats it. It sucks out the blood.&#x201d;</p><p>The younger one nods, ponders this information. The older one turns to go back inside.</p><p>&#x201c; But . . .&#x201d;</p><p>The older one, impatient, though she isn&#x2019;t sure why. &#x201c;What, Mei?&#x201d;</p><p>Her sister is pointing to the web again. It shimmers in the sun.</p><p>Catches the morning light.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Jie. See? It&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Part One</b></p><p><b>Miranda</b></p><p>Lucia said she was going to marry a one-armed Russian Jew. It came as a shock, this news, as I had met him only once before, briefly, when I was in town for a meeting with a pair of squat but handsome attorneys. His name was Yonah. He owned a health food store in the East Village, down the street from a tattoo parlor, across from City Video, next door to a Polish diner, beneath three floors of apartments that Lucia said he rented out to the yuppies who would soon take over the neighborhood. He had offered me tea, and I took peppermint green, and he scurried around, mashing Swiss chard and kale in a loud, industrial blender, barking orders to his nephews, or maybe they were second or third cousins (I never knew, there were so many), because they were sluggish in their work of unloading organic produce off the delivery trucks. He yelled often. I thought, This Yonah is quite a rough man.</p><p>He dusted the wine, mopped the floor, restocked packages of dried figs and goji berries and ginseng snacks on the shelves. He was industrious, I could see, intent on making his fortune as immigrants do. Lucia said he played chess. I&#x2019;d never known my sister to play chess, though she was always excellent at puzzles as a child. Yonah didn&#x2019;t seem to me the kind to play chess either, nor to drink sulfite-free organic wine or eat goji berries. But as they say, love is strange. And I wouldn&#x2019;t begrudge my sister love, nor any stranger, not even one who smoked, and was the kind of man who looked disheveled even fresh after a shower, and would leave his camo briefs lying around on the bathroom floor. I admit I was disturbed, creeped out, by his prosthetic arm, which he wore sometimes, though more often I&#x2019;d find it sitting by itself in a chair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lucia brought him to visit our mother, who was dying. Our mother was tilted back in a green suede recliner, wrapped in cotton blankets, watching the <i>Three Tenors </i>video we&#x2019;d given her the previous year. She took a long look at this man&#x2014;his workingman&#x2019;s shoulders, his dark-stubbled jaw, his wide, flat nose. Her Yoni had the essence of a duck, Lucia said (endearingly), or maybe a platypus, though she&#x2019;d never seen one up close. My sister liked to discern people&#x2019;s animal and vegetable essences. In fact, she was usually right.</p><p>Our mother winced as her gaze settled upon his left arm, a pale, peachy shade that did not match the rest of him. &#x201c;What happened to your arm?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;An accident, when I was twenty-one.&#x201d; He said it quietly, but without any shame.</p><p>&#x201c;In Soviet Union?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In Israel. I moved there when I was teenager.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are divorced,&#x201d; she said, and I tried to read his thoughts in the fluttering of his blue-gray eyes. I wondered if Lucia had warned him that our mother was like that. I wondered what had been shared, what omitted, when the two of them exchanged stories over chess, over wine. I wished to say to this man: <i>Do you really think you now know our Lucia?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Thirteen years,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have been divorced for thirteen years.&#x201d; Our mother winced again, though it could&#x2019;ve been from the pain shooting through her bowels, or her bones, or her chest.</p><p>&#x201c;You are Jewish,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Jewish are so aggressive. You have children?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They are with their mother, in Israel.&#x201d;</p><p>At the mention of the other woman, our mother spat. Once, I suppose, she would have wanted to know more, like what did he do, or how old were the children, or what were their names, or did they play musical instruments, and we might have told him that Lucia could recite twenty Chinese poems by the time she was three, or that she was a real talent on the violin, or that she&#x2019;d suffered a terrible bout of meningitis at age six and nearly died.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you divorced?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We were married too young,&#x201d; he said. The skin of his face seemed to hang off his cheekbones. A basset hound, I later said to Lucia.</p><p>&#x201c;This is life,&#x201d; he said to our mother.</p><p>She did not seem quite satisfied with this answer, though she nodded, expelled a heavy sigh. &#x201c;Take care of my daughter,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>But she was not looking at him. She was looking at me.</p><p>She fell asleep. Two weeks later, she was gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Three piles,&#x201d; said Lucia. &#x201c;Everything in three piles.&#x201d;<br><br>Keep. Salvation Army. Trash.</p><p>This was our strategy, tasked as we were with selling the house in New Jersey, as specified by our mother&#x2019;s will (our childhood home, marred by death, now considered &#x201c;inauspicious&#x201d;). So we sorted CorningWare and gas bills and soy sauce and ice trays and Cabbage Patch dolls and garden hoses and yarn and frying pans and Maurice Sendak books and twin bed sheet sets with faded Raggedy Ann and Andy pillowcases. Keep. Trash. Keep. Keep. Salvation Army. Trash. And when we reached Ma&#x2019;s bedroom, a hallowed hush, as if to acknowledge the finality in this sacred act of disturbance on which we now embarked. The desk where she&#x2019;d worked, pencil in hand; the throw pillows Lucia sewed one year in home economics class; the portable radio; the clock; her <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</i>s; the bed where she&#x2019;d lain tethered to her morphine drip, eyes closed, silent, body slack at last.</p><p>&#x201c;Fashion show?&#x201d; whispered Lucia.</p><p>&#x201c; Well . . .&#x201d; Why not?</p><p>We peered in the closet, the one we&#x2019;d raided often as impish children. We picked out two vintage cotton sundresses, one with chevron stripes, the other, zigzags. &#x201c;Twirl!&#x201d; said Lucia. &#x201c;You,&#x201d; I said, and in unison, our skirts puffed out like upside-down tulips.</p><p>We burst into tears. Twelve cycles of chemotherapy, three surgeries, three courses of radiation, two clinical trials, three remissions, four recurrences, over nine grueling&nbsp; years&#x2014;yet the permanence of Ma&#x2019;s absence still came as a shock.</p><p>We worked until late. At two in the morning, we decided to bake. We blasted Abba and Blondie and the Rolling Stones, broke out in song as flour and sugar flew everywhere. &#x201c;Almonds!&#x201d; said Lucia. &#x201c;We need almonds!&#x201d; Chinese almond cookies were Ma&#x2019;s favorite, so we set down our spatulas, drove to the twenty-four-hour pharmacy to shop for nuts.</p><p><i>We&#x2019;ll be roommates someday in an old folks&#x2019; home! We&#x2019;ll be cranky and play bridge and complain to the nurses about our hemorrhoids. Ha ha, when you&#x2019;re eighty I&#x2019;ll only be seventy-three!</i></p><p>No doubt the grief made us giddy. The late hour. The fatigue. But it was like that, to be with Lucia.</p><p>We fell asleep in the family room, the house buttery warm, the waffle-weave of sofa cushions imprinted on our cheeks. And then morning came. And with it came Yonah, roaring up the driveway in a giant rental truck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They married quickly, in City Hall. Lucia wore a sparkly tank top with pink bicycle pants, silver hoop earrings. She beamed, like a bride. Yonah wore his best khakis, a wrinkled white shirt, a bright red tie. I thought, <i>this </i>is who my sister is marrying: a man the shade of gravy, with a missing limb and a spaghetti-sauce-colored tie. I&#x2019;d never expected my sister to marry a more conventional man, or a Chinese man, or a highly educated man with a spotless r�sum�. Lucia had dated a Greek boy in high school, chosen NYU over Cornell, rejected math and sciences for English, all to our mother&#x2019;s dismay. And while her college dormmates had busied themselves with one incestuous hookup after the next, Lucia met a soft-spoken drummer who lived with four other musicians in Tribeca, ditched her violin for electric bass. She found her wanderlust, too, forgoing the air-conditioned offices and suits our mother and I were both familiar with to teach English in Ecuador, tutor in Brazil, volunteer at an orphanage in Bolivia. In her early twenties, she worked as a travel writer in Latin America for a small start-up firm, before returning to study journalism. She wrote feature articles now for a newspaper in&nbsp; Queens&#x2014;the next best thing, I suppose, as there she was friendly with halal butchers, Egyptian barbers, Salvadoran cooks and the old Chinese grocers who sold dog penises and exotic mushrooms for six hundred dollars a pound.</p><p>Still, I had not imagined this.</p><p>Yonah beamed, like a groom. He beamed with the whole of his wide, duck face and his wiry brows and his small, sticking-out ears. &#x201c;Take picture now!&#x201d; he barked, and I followed him through the rectangular window of my camera, trying to see what Lucia could see, and yes, he was rugged, fit, masculine. Attractive, one could say. I&#x2019;d never thought of Lucia marrying before me&#x2014; after all, she was younger by seven years. My <i>mei-mei</i>.</p><p>They had signed prenuptial agreements, at my insistence. I did not think Yonah was marrying for our mother&#x2019;s money (not a fortune, but far from meager), nor for Lucia&#x2019;s American citizenship, but I felt my concern was reasonable. &#x201c;Take more picture!&#x201d; he said. I did not like how often he spoke in imperatives, though I understood that English was not his native tongue. We had that in common. I did try to like him, I did.</p><p>After the two-minute ceremony, he hugged me fiercely, strong as a bear. <i>&#x201c;Sister!&#x201d;</i> he said. <i>&#x201c;Achoti! Hermana! Sestra! Belle soeur!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jie</i>,<i>&#x201d;</i> said Lucia.</p><p><i>&#x201c;J-yeah!&#x201d;</i> he said in a remarkably accurate third tone. He laughed from his belly. I liked that about him. Then he scooped up Lucia with his good arm and carried her down seven flights of stairs, out to the plaza where spring blossoms danced and songbirds chirped and a rainbow might have appropriately appeared. He spun her around and around and Lucia shrieked with delight, her arms outstretched, head thrown back, bobbed hair and sharp chin shining in rays of new sun. &#x201c;My wife, she is beauuuu-ti-ful,&#x201d; he sang, and Lucia&#x2019;s eyes shone with such clarity that even my most shrouded worries burned off like a morning fog. They were in love. Our mother, I was sure, could know this safely, from wherever that place is where the dead view the living.</p></p><h2>DAREDEVIL OMNIBUS VOL. 1 (Daredevil Omnibus, 1)</h2><p>Born to a past-his-prime prizefighter, Matt Murdock's luck always ran a step behind his good intentions.

And why not? <i>Joy</i> in hand, tens of millions of people -- from novices to professionals -- have learned to do everything from make a meat loaf to clean a squid to frost a wedding cake. For decades, <i>Joy of Cooking</i> has taught America how to cook, serving as the standard against which all other cookbooks are judged. <br> <i>All About Soups &amp; Stews</i> upholds that standard. While keeping the conversational and instructional manner of the flagship book, <i>All About Soups &amp; Stews</i> is organized into ten chapters that cover stocks and broths, chowders, fish and seafood soups and stews, fruit soups, and more. This book incorporates more than 130 of <i>Joy's</i> best-loved recipes -- Chicken Stock to Irish Stew to Melon Soup. You'll also find recipes for a dozen or more condiments and quick breads, as well as techniques for straining and storing stock. Add to that more than 150 original photographs, specially commissioned for this volume, presented in the most easy-to-use design imaginable. <br> Whether you belong to one of the millions of American households that already own a copy (or two) of <i>Joy,</i> or you have never cracked the spine of a cookbook before, <i>Joy of Cooking: All About Soups &amp; Stews</i> is for you. It is a spectacular achievement, worthy of its name. <i>Joy</i> has never been more beautiful. <br> <i><b>The Indispensable Kitchen Resource... <br>All-New, All-Purpose, and now All-in-Color</b></i></p><p>Soups and stews are much-loved kitchen standbys, and the reasons are obvious: they can be made out of just about anything on hand, they can serve as a starter course or as a nutritious one-pot meal, and most can be made ahead of time. So it's no surprise that the folks over at <i>The Joy of Cooking</i> headquarters thought to devote an entire volume of their All About series to these fabulous dishes. <p> Adapted from <i>The Joy of Cooking</i>, this volume is coauthored by original <i>Joy</i> author Irma Rombauer, her daughter Marion Rombauer Becker, and her grandson Ethan Becker. It retains the conversational yet instructional tone that made the original such a favorite, and covers everything a cook needs to know to become a master of soups and stews. It is a comprehensive treatment of the subject, with 130 recipes, but, more important, it carries on the teaching tradition of <i>Joy</i> by explaining what may seem like mysterious secrets to the inexperienced cook but turn out to be easy-to-follow rules. Once incorporated into one's repertoire, these techniques can transform a person from a novice to a truly accomplished cook. For instance, the authors point out that simmering a stock too long can result in bitterness and explain exactly how to tell when it has simmered long enough (when a piece of meat retrieved from the stock is completely devoid of flavor). Since good stock or broth is arguably the most vital element in any soup or stew, the book offers easy-to-follow instructions for all types of bases--including vegetable, fish, chicken, beef, game, and even "express" chicken and beef stocks for those short on time.</p><p> Like the original <i>Joy</i>, this volume covers the classics, such as Potato Leek Soup, Fresh Tomato Soup, and Beef Stew, and surprises with a delightful array of more unusual fare, such as Tomato Jalape�o Chilaquiles, Mongolian Hot Pot, and Wild Caribbean Black Bean Chili. Early editions of <i>Joy</i> used the phrase "making the pot smile" to describe the gentle simmering required for soups and stews. This volume gives not only the pot but the people who eat what's inside many reasons to smile. <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p>Irma Rombauer self-published the first&nbsp;<i>Joy of Cooking</i>&nbsp;in 1931. In 1936, the first commercial edition was published by Bobbs-Merrill. Marion Rombauer Becker, Irma&#x2019;s daughter, helped revise and update each subsequent edition until 1951. The 1963 edition was the first after Irma&#x2019;s death and was completely Marion&#x2019;s. Her son, Ethan Becker, helped Marion revise the 1975 edition, and then oversaw the 1997 and 75th Anniversary editions. Ethan&#x2019;s son, John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott are the first of the family to be solely responsible for testing, revising, and updating the book since 1975, ensuring the latest edition is given the same love and attention to detail that made this culinary resource an American classic.<br><br>Ethan Becker is the son of Marion Rombauer Becker and the grandson of Irma S.

His consciousness revolves around being a member of a church whose beliefs he finds not only confusing but terrifying. Composed of a hodgepodge of requirements and restrictions (including a prohibition against doctors and hospitals), the underpinning tenet of Herbert W. Armstrong&#x2019;s Worldwide Church of God was that its members were divinely chosen and all others would soon perish in rivers of flames.<br><br>The substantial membership was ruled by fear, intimidation, and threats. Anyone who dared leave the church would endure hardship for the remainder of this life and eternal suffering in the next. The next life, according to Armstrong, would arrive in 1975, three years after the start of the Great Tribulation. Jerry would be eleven years old.<br><br>Jerry&#x2019;s parents were particularly vulnerable to the promise of relief from the world&#x2019;s hardships. When they joined the church, in 1960, they were living in a two-room apartment in a dangerous Chicago housing project with the first four of their seven children, and, most significantly, they both were blind, having lost their sight to childhood accidents. They took comfort in the belief that they had been chosen for a special afterlife, even if it meant following a religion with a white supremacist ideology and dutifully sending tithes to Armstrong, whose church boasted more than 100,000 members and more than $80 million in annual revenues at its height.<br><br>When the prophecy of the 1972 Great Tribulation does not materialize, Jerry is considerably less disappointed than relieved. When the 1975 end-time prophecy also fails, he finally begins to question his faith and imagine the possibility of choosing a destiny of his own.</p><p><b>Jerald Walker</b> is a professor of creative writing at Emerson College. His writing has appeared in publications such as the <i>Harvard Review</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, the <i>Iowa Review</i>; the <i>Missouri Review</i>; the <i>Oxford American</i>; the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, and <i>Creative Nonfiction</i>, as well as four times in <i>Best American Essays</i>. He is the author of <i>Street Shadows: A Memoir of Race, Rebellion, and Redemption</i>, which won the PEN New England/L. L. Winship Award for Nonfiction.&#x201c;The key to the memoir&#x2019;s cumulative power is Walker&#x2019;s narrative command; the rite of passage is rockier than most, making the redemption well-earned.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Jerald Walker has a remarkable story to tell, and he tells it with a wealth of grace and intelligence at his command.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Vivian Gornick</p><h2>Helen in Egypt</h2><p>Written by an active poet in both the American and British modern movement. A book of verse expounding on Helen of Troy. Use of the intuitive world of magic, ritual and hieroglyphics.</p><p>The fabulous beauty of Helen of Troy is legendary. But some say that Helen was never in Troy, that she had been conveyed by Zeus to Egypt, and that Greeks and Trojans alike fought for an illusion. A fifty-line fragment by the poet Stesichorus of Sicily (c. 640-555 B.C.), what survives of his Pallinode, tells us almost all we know of this other Helen, and from it H. D. wove her book-length poem. Yet Helen in Egypt is not a simple retelling of the Egyptian legend but a recreation of the many myths surrounding Helen, Paris, Achilles, Theseus, and other figures of Greek tradition, fused with the mysteries of Egyptian hermeticism.H.D. (1886-1961) (the pen name of Hilda Doolittle) was born in the Moravian community of Bethlehem, PA in 1886. A major twentieth century poet with &#x201c;an ear more subtle than Pound&#x2019;s, Moore&#x2019;s, or Yeats&#x2019;s&#x201d; as Marie Ponsot writes, she was the author of several volumes of poetry, fiction, essays, and memoirs. She is perhaps one of the best-known and prolific women poets of the Modernist era. Bryher Ellerman was a novelist and H.D.&#x2019;s wealthy companion. She financed H.D.&#x2019;s therapy with Freud.</p><h2>Never Anyone But You: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>Named a Best Book of the Year by&nbsp;<i>The Guardian, The Observer,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Sydney Morning Herald.&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>The true story of a love affair between two extraordinary women becomes a literary tour deforce in this novel that recreates the surrealist movement in Paris and the horrors of the two world wars with a singular incandescence and intimacy.</b><br><br>In the years preceding World War I, two young women meet, by chance, in a provincial town in France. Suzanne Malherbe, a shy seventeen-year-old with a talent for drawing, is completely entranced by the brilliant but troubled Lucie Schwob, who comes from a family of wealthy Jewish intellectuals. They embark on a clandestine love affair, terrified they will be discovered, but then, in an astonishing twist of fate, the mother of one marries the father of the other. As &#x201c;sisters&#x201d; they are finally free of suspicion, and, hungry for a more stimulating milieu, they move to Paris at a moment when art, literature, and politics blend in an explosive cocktail.<br><br>Having reinvented themselves as Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore, they move in the most glamorous social circles, meeting everyone from Hemingway and Dal� to Andr� Breton, and produce provocative photographs that still seem avant-garde today. In the 1930s, with the rise of anti-Semitism and threat of fascism, they leave Paris for Jersey, and it is on this idyllic island that they confront their destiny, creating a campaign of propaganda against Hitler&#x2019;s occupying forces that will put their lives in jeopardy.<br><br>Brilliantly imagined, profoundly thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking,&nbsp;<i>Never Anyone But You</i>&nbsp;infuses life into a forgotten history as only great literature can.</p><p><b>Rupert Thomson</b> is the author of nine highly acclaimed novels, including <i>Secrecy</i>; <i>The Insult</i>, which was shortlisted for the Guardian Fiction Prize and selected by David Bowie as one of his 100 Must-Read Books of All Time; <i>The Book of Revelation,</i> which was made into a feature film by Ana Kokkinos; and <i>Death of a Murderer</i>, which was shortlisted for the Costa Novel of the Year Award.

Through the measured but incisive voice of Suzanne Malherbe, the reader enters the intimate world of two life-long lovers, artistic collaborators, and anti-Nazi rebels who left behind a haunting photographic legacy. After I finished this acute and tender book, I felt that two fascinating ghosts had become real.&#x201d; &#x2014;Siri Hustvedt, author of <i>The Blazing World</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In this novel about Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore, Rupert Thomson tells the thrilling story of how, fusing love and art, one of the great collaborative partnerships of the twentieth century mounted an unthinkably brave, largely unsung campaign of political witness and resistance. The voice Thomson gives Marcel is a brilliant invention: flashes of poetry trouble the patina of its self-control, intimations of the wildness and terror of genius.&#x201d; &#x2014;Garth Greenwell, author of <i>What Belongs to You<br> </i><br>&#x201c;Hands down, Rupert Thomson is one of my favorite writers of all time. I impatiently wait for his new novels and he never disappoints. The atmospheric <i>Never Anyone But You</i> is exquisitely crafted and pulls you deep into the love affair of two extraordinary women. Magnificent. As always.&#x201d; &#x2014;Andrea Wulf, author of <i>The Invention of Nature<br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>Never Anyone But You</i> puts a hidden piece of history into its long-overdue place in the spotlight. Rupert Thomson deftly weaves a story that spans several decades&#x2014;the Paris Surrealists, Nazi-occupied Jersey, heroic acts of resistance, and intense and enduring (and forbidden) love&#x2014;into one seamless whole. Nail-bitingly tense and incredibly moving.&#x201d; &#x2014;Monica Ali, author of <i><i>Brick Lane</i><br></i></p><h2>Japan&#39;s World War II Balloon Bomb Attacks on North America</h2><p>Between 1944 and 1945, the Japanese military launched almost ten thousand bomb-bearing balloons across the Pacific ocean. Intended to spark forest fires and shake American morale, the balloons were beset by technical problems and never achieved their destructive potential, but were nonetheless responsible for the only six war deaths on the United States mainland.

She went underwater in a stunned state, but she never lost her orientation. Even before her downward plunge slowed, she was clawing against the sea to propel herself back up. When her head broke the surface, she gasped for air. The waves rose around her, but she fought them. Focusing on that singular need to breathe, she used her arms and legs to create a rhythm matching that of the sea in an effort to keep herself afloat.</p><p>Her breath came in shallow gasps, along with a creeping awareness of what had happened. She heard in echo the sound of screams, an impact, and an explosion, all drawn from immediate memory. Pushing wet hair from her eyes, she looked around, trying to get her bearings. The waves were littered with pieces of wood, ejected from the boat just as she had been, but where the rest of the <i>Amelia Celeste</i> should have been there were now flames furiously devouring wood and God knew what else, and the line between black smoke and white fog was lost.</p><p>Instinct told her to move away from the fire, so she fought the tug of the waves and pulled herself backward. Her sandals were gone, as was her pocketbook, and when she felt the weight of the wet quilted blazer dragging her down, she slid her arms from that, too. She was trembling, though she didn't know whether from cold or from shock. Fear hadn't yet set in.</p><p>"Hey!" came a shout from the smoky haze, then a head appeared. It was the man who had been with her in the bow. He was swimming toward her. "Are you hurt?" he called loudly enough to be heard above the roar of the flames.</p><p>She didn't think she was. Everything seemed to be working. "No," she called back.</p><p>"Hold on to this," he said as he pulled forward what he'd been towing. It was a long seat cushion, clearly buoyant. "I'm going back in."</p><p>Grasping the cushion, Julia was about to ask if that was possible, when another staggering explosion came. She barely had time to take a breath when the man pulled her under to escape the falling debris. By the time they resurfaced, gasping and sputtering, treading water in the churn of the waves, the hail was done.</p><p>Going back in was a moot point, then. The flames were louder, the smoke more dense.</p><p>In obvious anguish, the man stared at the devastation. Seemingly as an afterthought, he tore his eyes from the smoke, looked around for the cushion, swam for it, towed it back. "Hold on," he said, and when Julia complied, he dragged the cushion through the waves, farther away from the wreck. All the while he stared into the smoke and the flames.</p><p>Suddenly, he did an about-face in the water and turned those anguished eyes in the opposite direction. <i>"Hey!"</i> he screamed in desperation toward what Julia assumed was the shore. <i>"Get out here! Hey! There are people who need help!"</i></p><p>Julia knew he wasn't referring to himself or to her. They appeared to be unscathed, but there were all those others on the far side of the flames, who might have been hit by debris, knocked unconscious by the explosion, or burned by the fire.</p><p>Incredibly, the man began to swim toward the smoke.</p><p>"Don't go!" Julia cried. She had visions of his disappearing and never being heard from again -- or perhaps she just didn't want to be left alone. The fog was thick, the fire close, and she had no idea how far they were from shore. For the first time then, with a marginal grasp of what had happened, she did feel fear. The ocean was a big place and she an infinitesimally tiny dot in its midst. Two dots were better than one.</p><p>He kept swimming. After a minute, though, he stopped. He bobbed in place, staring at the flames, before recalculating and swimming to the left of the fire, but the waves fought him there, pushing him back when he might have moved on. So he let himself be carried back to where she was and, once there, grabbed hold of the cushion.</p><p>"Did you see anyone else?" she asked. She was breathing hard, but nowhere near as hard as he was.</p><p>He shook his head, then twisted it back toward shore again. It was another minute before Julia heard what he had, and another minute after that before a boat emerged from the fog. A working lobster boat, it was smaller than the <i>Amelia Celeste</i> and nowhere near as polished, but Julia had never seen anything as welcome in her life.</p><p>In no time, she had been helped over the side and into the boat, wrapped in a blanket and settled in the small cabin under the bow. Once there, though, she began to shake in earnest, because not only were those sounds reverberating in her mind -- screams, impact, explosion -- but she could see it again: the sudden emergence of a huge purple point coming out of the fog, just high enough to start right over the side of the ferry, before crashing down in its midst.</p><p>Unable to sit still, Julia went back up to the deck, where she stood, dripping wet and trembling under the blanket, now with a hand at her mouth and her eyes on the fog. The smell of smoke was overwhelming; she raised the blanket over her nose to diffuse it.</p><p>The man who had been with her in the water was also aboard, but there was no blanket for him, no coddling. He and two others were leaning over the side, peering through the fog and smoke as the boat dodged its way along between pieces of wood, fiberglass, and miscellaneous other matter that Julia couldn't identify. Some were burning, some were not.</p><p>The ghost of another search boat flickered briefly in the fog before heading in the opposite direction. When a third search boat appeared, it drew alongside, and the man who had been with her in the water climbed into it.</p><p>Julia didn't ask questions, and he didn't look back. He was clearly a local, known by the men in both boats, no doubt known by the rest who had been in the <i>Amelia Celeste.</i> He was worried.</p><p>Feeling a deep sense of dread, she watched the third boat pull away. She followed the sound of it, struggling to see through the fog, until her own boat turned away.</p><p>"We're gonna get you in," the captain explained as the boat picked up speed.</p><p>"You don't have to," she said quickly. "I'm okay. Shouldn't we stay here and help with the search?" She felt a need to do that.</p><p>But the captain simply said, "I'll drop you ashore and come back," and sped on.</p><p>Chilled as the wind whipped through her wet hair, Julia took shelter in the wheelhouse, eyes on the front windshield, waiting for sign of land. Within minutes, a darkness materialized, a body of land rising from the water, with a serrated skyline rising high above it. Another minute, and the mist thinned to reveal a small fishing village built into a hillside.</p><p>The boat pulled up at the dock. Of the islanders already gathered there, one woman ran forward.</p><p>Zoe Ballard was Julia's mother's youngest sister, a late-in-life child, barely twelve years older than Julia. That closeness in age alone would have been enough to justify the bond Julia felt. More, though, Zoe was interesting and adventurous, irreverent, independent. She was everything Julia was not but admired nonetheless.</p><p>And now here she was, wearing a woven patchwork jacket and frayed jeans, her chestnut hair windblown, her features delicate like Julia's, eyes filled with tears. But her arms were strong, helping Julia as she stumbled off the boat, then hugging her tightly for what seemed like forever. Julia didn't complain. She couldn't stop shaking. Zoe's strength helped. She felt safe with her, safe on dry land, safe and alive -- and suddenly terrified that others were not. She looked back at the boat in time to see it head out again.</p><p>That quickly, the crowd closed in, and the questions began.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"How many were on the <i>Amelia Celeste?"</i></p><p>"Have they pulled others from the water?"</p><p>Not knowing where to look, Julia focused on Zoe. "A boat hit us. There were six, seven, maybe eight others on the ferry."</p><p>"Did you catch any names?" Zoe asked and Julia understood why. Ferries like the <i>Amelia Celeste</i> were casual things. Tickets weren't booked ahead; there would be no list of passengers. Any information Julia could give would be a help to the islanders gathered there.</p><p>But she could only shake her head. The rest of her body continued to tremble. "I was in the bow. They were in the stern."</p><p>She tried to picture the group she had seen when she boarded the boat, but the image was vague. Running down that dock, she had been distracted and tense after a harrowing seven-hour drive up from Manhattan. It should have been an easy drive -- <i>would</i> have been, had she left when she had originally planned. But her husband had given her a raft of last-minute errands, treating her as usual like a maid, something she had come to sorely resent. Driving out of the city, she had wallowed in that resentment, mentally arguing with Monte as she didn't dare do in person, venting a frustration that had been building for years. Add to that the growing realization that she was late enough to miss the ferry she was booked on, that she didn't know if there was another ferry that day, and that she had no idea where she would spend the night if she didn't get to the island, and her level of tension had risen. She had driven above the speed limit much of the way, a problem in and of itself. She didn't drive often, least of all on the highway. What she had hoped would be a pleasant drive had turned into a white-knuckle experience.</p><p>The only good thing had been her luck in finding the <i>Amelia Celeste</i> ready to leave.</p><p>Lucked out? Well, perhaps. She was alive and well. But others?</p><p>"Her arm's bleeding," said a man who emerged from the crowd. He didn't appear to be out of his thirties, though he carried an air of mature confidence. "Can I check her out?"</p><p>Julia was startled to see the blood on the underside of her forearm.</p><p>"He's a doctor," Zoe explained quietly. Stepping out of her clogs, she knelt to put them on Julia's feet.</p><p>Julia put a hand on her shoulder for balance. "Won't a Band-Aid do?" she asked, because she didn't want to leave the dock.</p><p>"Hi...</p></p><h2>Ines of My Soul</h2><p><p>This magisterial work of historical fiction recounts the astonishing life of In�s Su�rez, a daring Spanish conquistadora who toiled to build the nation of Chile&#x2014;and whose vital role has too often been neglected by history.</p><p>It is the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when In�s&#x2019;s shiftless husband disappears to the New World, she uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure.

Born in Peru and raised in Chile, she lives in California.</p>Isabel Allende has crafted a compelling saga that adds to her repertoire of master storytelling. Blair Brown's impeccable performance brings Allende's eloquent prose to life, expressing the innermost thoughts of In�s Suarez, who is dictating her memoir. In�s reflects on her incredible journey from Spain to the founding of Santiago in the 1540s. With Pedro Valdivia, the first gobernador of the kingdom, In�s witnesses the cruelty and barbarism of the Spanish conquistadors and the native Chileans. The atrocities and brutality of the conquest are not spared in the narration, and some descriptions are not for the fainthearted. Brown's pronunciations and accents provide authenticity to the production, but it is her talent that brings the listener into the heart of the story.

Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Faith of the Fatherless: The Psychology of Atheism</h2><p>Starting with Freud's "projection theory" of religion-that belief in God is merely a product of man's desire for security-Professor Vitz argues that psychoanalysis actually provides a more satisfying explanation for atheism. Disappointment in one's earthly father, whether through death, absence, or mistreatment, frequently leads to a rejection of God. A biographical survey of influential atheists of the past four centuries shows that this "defective father hypothesis" provides a consistent explanation of the "intense atheism" of these thinkers. A survey of the leading intellectual defenders of Christianity over the same period confirms the hypothesis, finding few defective fathers. Professor Vitz concludes with an intriguing comparison of male and female atheists and a consideration of other psychological factors that can contribute to atheism. <p>Professor Vitz does not argue that atheism is psychologically determined. Each man, whatever his experiences, ultimately chooses to accept God or reject him. Yet the cavalier attribution of religious faith to irrational, psychological needs is so prevalent that an exposition of the psychological factors predisposing one to atheism is necessary.</p></p><p>PAUL C. VITZ, a professor of psychology at New York University, was an atheist until his late 30s. He earned his bachelor&#39;s degree at the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. at Stanford. Professor Vitz is the author of Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship, Modern Art and Modern Science, and Sigmund Freud&#39;s Christian Unconscious, as well as numerous articles in professional and popular journals. He and his wife, Evelyn Birge Vitz, also a professor at NYU, raised their six children in a faculty apartment in Greenwich Village.Vitz (psychology, New York U.), an atheist himself until his 30s, exposes atheism to the same psychological analysis atheistic apologists have used to debunk religious belief. Beginning with Freud's notion that belief in God is a product of humanity's desire for security, he argues that psychoanalysis is actually a better explanation for denial of God, concluding that the absence of a good father is at the core of militant atheism. Surveys of the leading intellectual defenders of atheism and Christianity, show that the atheists had "defective fathers" while the believers did not. Vitz does not intend to suggest that atheism is psychologically determined, but rather hopes to counteract the idea that irrational psychological factors lead one to believe in God. Annotation c.

The regrettable fact today is that large pharmaceutical companies dictate what therapies doctors are likely to prescribe. Once effective treatments lose patent protection, they fall into a deep abyss and are often forgotten in conventional medicine practice. The Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones, authored by Edward Lichten, M.D., memorializes 100 years of discoveries made by pioneering physicians who have used non-patented, bio-identical hormones to prevent and treat a wide range of common diseases. Combating the Medical Establishment While battling an apathetic and often hostile medical establishment, Dr. Lichten has successfully applied, refined, and invented medical treatments that can reverse the course of disorders as diverse as migraine, type II diabetes, PMS, congestive heart failure, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis and insomnia. Treatments are supported in the scientific medical literature and/or reflect the many successful patient outcomes Dr. Lichten has observed in this practice. The case histories presented in the Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones are by themselves compelling enough to make it a must read for physicians and health conscious individuals seeking safe, natural and effective approaches to intractable illnesses. For those not yet suffering serious disease, this book provides a roadmap for maturing women and men to safely restore their full compliment of youth hormones. The benefit of natural hormone restoration is the reversal of many unwanted effects that aging inflicts on the human body. About Edward Lichten Edward M. Lichten, M.D. became board certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1976. A Fellow of the College of Surgeons and the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Dr. Lichten soon realized that standard medical therapy left too many individuals untreated. Dr. Lichten responded by systematically pursuing alternative medical, natural and then original bio-identical research until finding therapies that he could prove would work. He discovered the cause of menstrual pain--a simple treatment and potential cure in 1982; a non-psychiatric drug treatment for premenstrual syndrome and depression in 1985; a true breakthrough in the treatment of a woman&#39;s migraines and men&#39;s cluster headaches in 1989 and in 1991. His most cherished discover occurred in 1997 when he proved to his colleagues that diabetes in men is primarily a testosterone deficiency syndrome. Pictured with a few of his dedicated and &#34;I-want-to-live-a-healthy-life-until-I&#39;m-100-years-old&#34; patients, Dr. Lichten believes that we have the science and understanding to live much longer and better lives. He practices what he preaches and writes scientific articles for his peers to review. A veteran speaker having given more than 100 lectures on four continents, Dr. Lichten remains dedicated to the dictum of &#39;treating one patient at a time&#39; for his or her individual needs. Dr. Lichten practices in southeastern Michigan. He wrote this book because of the dangerous state of confusion about what women and men should do to properly balance their hormones. As Dr. Lichten stated: &#34;This book serves as an outreach...to those who I will never meet, but will hopefully find effective solutions to their medical concerns via the information conveyed herein.&#34; Life Extension expects that the Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones will soon become part of the library of thousands of innovative physicians around the world. The cover price of the Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones is $49.95.</p><p>About the Author Edward M. Lichten, M.D. is an Ohio State university trained, Board Certified Obstetrician-Gynecologist who has spent 30 years in private medical practice treating, researching, inventing and rediscovering ways to use bio-identical and natural therapies to treat his patients diseases. His philosophy is that the body can most often heal itself if supplied with the proper building blocks of vitamins, minerals, fats and especially bio-identical hormones. A national and international lecturer, Dr. Lichten enjoys the opportunity to speak with patients and health providers alike as they all can work together to better understand the benefits of natural and bio-identical treatments in maintaining and improving health care.

Lichten, M.D., F.A.C.S. The contents of this book are aimed principally to the general public and other health care professional. We are in an era in which the general public has become activists for their own health care. Many means are now available, but the web has answered many requests, however, books are still the primary source for learning. I have produced 40 textbooks in Obstetrics and Gynecology and read thousands of manuscripts as Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, but none like this book by Dr. Lichten. I would like to identify this book as the book of the future as it is not like the standard textbook of today. It will energize your thinking and will make you ask many questions about the present and the future [of health care]. The book is divided into three logical parts with many subheadings. BOOK I: The Role of Natural Hormones involving the Pineal, Pituitary, Thyroid and Adrenal glands; BOOK II: The Role of Natural Estrogen for Women including Menopause, Ovaries, Progesterone, Testosterone, Menstrual Migraine and Osteoporosis; and BOOK III: The Role of Natural Testosterone for Men including Male-Andropause, Heart and Cardiovascular Disease, and Diabetes. Dr. Lichten says that the theme of this book is The body can most often heal itself if supplied with the proper building blocks of vitamins, minerals, fats and especially bio-identical hormones. We live in a time of too much information to evaluate from the newspapers, magazines, books, the Internet and your health care professionals. How do you know what you read is totally true or partially true? Your interpretation of this information makes it valuable or of no value at all. Dr. Lichten has used scientific methodology to help you understand his book. He has developed a generous scientific literature with multiple references that are both clinical and scientifically sound on each topic. This book is almost a medical autobiography of the past that he has encountered, as well as thought for the future. This book is not intended to be evidence based medicine as this only pertains to individual publications and not textbooks. This book also lays foundations for the future. First, people must believe that [health care] has viability [and that they are the co-pilot on their quest for good health]. The proof of the pudding can only come with time. Concepts, and precepts, and understanding do not come easy. It takes cerebration, imagination and perseverance to make things happen. May you enjoy reading this book as I did. Frederick P. Zuspan, M.D. Chairman Emeritus Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology The Ohio State University School of Medicine and Public Health --Frederick P. Zuspan, M.D.; foreword<br><br>Health Care is Sacred Work. Health caring is sacred work. Health caring begins with a decision to give of one s self so that another may begin the process of healing and recovery. Health caring is a calling, a vocation. The basis of health caring is love...love for others, even those difficult to love. Health caring is about continuously improving how we care for and about others. Continuously improving health caring begins with asking questions...questions about what we know, and perhaps more importantly about what we do not know. This book is about asking those questions...as well as about moving all of us who provide health care back to a place of caring, which means questioning ourselves, getting to know our patients, and loving our patients. I have known and worked with Dr. Lichten for approximately six years. During that time I have been most impressed by his absolute commitment to the health and welfare of his patients. This has caused Dr. Lichten to constantly question the traditional dogma of medicine, and at times traditional care provided to patients. He has been on a quest to know all that is known about health, including educating himself about traditional, complementary, and alternative forms of therapy. This has led him to collide with the medical administration and to, at times to move toward natural health to support his patients as he searches for truth and patient-centered solutions. Ernie Yoder, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.P. --Ernest Yoder, M.D., preface<br><br>New Book Reveals Benefits of Aggressive Hormone Therapy to Prevent and Treat a Wide Range of Disorders For the past 27 years, Life Extension has interacted with pioneering physicians who have developed novel methods of treating chronic illnesses. While these doctors prescribe avant-garde therapies in their daily practices, their innovations too often remain unpublished and out of the public domain, thus depriving the world of vital life-saving information. Edward Lichten, MD, FACS, has painstakingly put in to writing the many successful protocols he has discovered in his decades of clinical practice. Among the disorders covered are congestive heart failure, type II diabetes, adrenal exhaustion, migraine, insomnia, andropause, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, and others. The Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones provides creative strategies for circumventing chronic illnesses that are not adequately treated by mainstream medicine. It will help enlighten both physicians and interested lay people about aggressive, but safe methods to combat the most prevalent health concerns of today s aging population. Dr. Lichten s Personal Experience Based on his extensive clinical experience, Dr. Lichten s book not only illustrates the essential benefits of restoring hormone balance in aging men and women, but more importantly, directly tackles the controversy that surrounds hormone replacement. Unfortunately, most physicians fail to properly understand the body s need for hormones at all stages of life, and are therefore unnecessarily reluctant to prescribe proper hormone therapy for their patients. Despite the complexity of this topic, the Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones speaks to the reader in a friendly, conversational tone. Dr. Lichten clearly states from the very beginning of the book that, I am compelled to write this book because of the dangerous state of confusion that exists concerning what aging women and men should do to properly balance their hormones. Vitamin D for Protection The Textbook of Bio-Identical Hormones opens with an important discussion of the often overlooked yet critically important pro-hormone, vitamin D. Once believed to do little more than regulate bone health, vitamin D is a multi-functional hormone precursor that is increasingly being recognized as a crucial factor in protecting against various cancers, preserving bone integrity, bolstering the immune system, and even warding off debilitating depression. Dr. Lichten emphasizes that, The majority of humans do not have adequate blood levels of vitamin D and maladies that occur in response to less than optimal vitamin D include insomnia, heart disease, and cancer. So, what does vitamin D have to do with hormone therapy? Dr. Lichten makes an interesting connection, I am particularly concerned about women being prescribed estrogen drugs without factoring in their needs for natural progesterone, vitamin D and a healthy diet, he states. Vitamin D functions as a cell regulatory brake to protect against the initiation and progression of common cancers, including those of the breast. Prescribing aging women estrogen without ensuring adequate vitamin D status is analogous to driving a car without brakes, he states. Dr. Lichten is not alone in sounding the alarm regarding this crucial but underappreciated pro-hormone. His chapter on vitamin D is supported by the knowledge that vitamin D insufficiency, as well as outright deficiency, is rampant among men, women and children throughout the developed world, including the United States. --Dale Kiefer: Life Extension Magazine Dec 2007</p><h2>Codes, Ciphers, Secrets and Cryptic Communication: Making and Breaking Secret Messages from Hieroglyphs to the Internet</h2><p>Covert communications have won or lost wars, exposed political intrigue, disguised secret religions and societies, and secured financial transactions.

I worshipped Darren Stevens the First. When he&#x2019;d come home from work and Samantha would say, &#x2018;Darren, would you like me to fix you a drink?&#x2019; He&#x2019;d always rest his briefcase on the table below the mirror in the foyer, wipe his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief and say, &#x2018;Better make it a double.&#x2019;&#x201d; (from Chapter Two)<br><br>You may not know it, but you&#x2019;ve met Augusten Burroughs. You&#x2019;ve seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn&#x2019;t really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that&#x2019;s when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life&#x2014;and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that&#x2019;s as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true. <i>Dry </i>is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a Higher Power. <br></p><p>Fans of Augusten Burroughs's darkly funny memoir <i>Running with Scissors</i> were left wondering at the end of that book what would become of young Augusten after his squalid and fascinating childhood ended. In <i>Dry</i>, we find that although adult Augusten is doing well professionally, earning a handsome living as an ad writer for a top New York agency, Burroughs's personal life is a disaster. His apartment is a sea of empty Dewar's bottles, he stays out all night boozing, and he dabs cologne on his tongue in an unsuccessful attempt to mask the stench of alcohol on his breath at work. When his employer insists he seek help, Burroughs ships out to Minnesota for detoxification, counseling, and amusingly told anecdotes about the use of stuffed animals in group therapy. But after a month of such treatment, he's back in Manhattan and tenuously sober. And while its one thing to lay off the sauce in rehab, Burroughs learns that it's quite another to resume your former life while avoiding the alcohol that your former life was based around. This quest to remain sober is made dramatically more difficult, and the tale more harrowing, when Burroughs begins an ill-advised romance with a crack addict. Certainly the "recovered alcoholic fighting to stay sober" tale is not new territory for a memoirist. But Burroughs's account transcends clich�s: it doesn't adhere to the traditional "temptation narrowly resisted" storyline and it features, in Burroughs himself, a central character that is sympathetic even when he's neither likable nor admirable. But what ultimately makes this memoir such a terrific read is a brilliant and candid sense of humor that manages to stay dry even when recalling events where the author was anything but. <i>--John Moe</i>Augusten Burroughs is the author of <i>Running with Scissors</i>, <i>Magical Thinking: True Stories</i>, <i>Possible Side Effects</i>, <i>A Wolf at the Table</i>&nbsp;and <i>You Better Not Cry</i>.

This slim but illuminating volume is one of the few surviving<br>texts by the prolific Baghdadi scholar Ibn al-Sa'i,<br>who chronicled the academic and political elites of his city in the final years<br>of the Abbasid dynasty and the period following the cataclysmic Mongol invasion<br>of 656 H/1258 AD.</p><p>In this work, Ibn al-Sa'i is keen to<br>forge a connection between the munificent wives of his time and the storied<br>lovers of the so-called golden age of Baghdad.

His memoir of what he found, <i>A Walk Across America</i>, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.<br><br>Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land. Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.<br><br><i>Looking for Alaska</i> is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home. <br><br>He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a "home base" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.<br><br>All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again.<br></p><p>In 1999, Peter Jenkins and his family left their farm in Tennessee to live in Alaska for a few seasons, eventually renting a house in Seward, Alaska (pop. 2,830) on the Kenai Peninsula. The principal aim of the trip was for Jenkins to write a travelogue, but he also saw it as an opportunity to end a period of personal stagnation. It appears to have worked, for <i>Looking for Alaska</i> is filled with a vibrancy that can only come from one with a fully charged battery. Recognizing that "This giant place is filled with people determined to live as free as possible of others' intervention," he employed the same low-key approach to research that made his bestselling book <i>A Walk Across America</i> (1979) so engaging--he made friends wherever he went and allowed people to share their stories in their own way and in their own time. Part of Jenkins's charm is that he never pretends that he's figured the place out; he readily cops to his outsider status and invites readers to experience his sense of awe and surprise with him. During his 18-month stay in the Last Frontier, Jenkins spent time with wildlife rangers, recreation guides, native whalers, fishermen, and dogsled mushers, all of whom showed Jenkins and his family glimpses of their own private Alaska. (They also shared their bear stories; it seems nearly everyone in the state has had at least one run-in with the giant predator). "No one is ever the same after coming back from Alaska," he writes and after reading his book, it's easy to believe him. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i>Peter Jenkins' 1979 written chronicle and photographs of his first journey, <i>A Walk Across America</i>, spent three months on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list. Jenkins has written several more chronicles of his travels, including <i>The New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Walk West </i>and <i>Across China</i>, and <i>Along the Edge of America</i> and <i>Close Friends</i>. Born in Greenwich, Connecticut, he now lives on a farm in Spring Hill, Tennessee, with his wife, Rita, and their family.<br></p><h2>The Lost Library of the King of Portugal</h2><p>The destruction on the morning of All Saints Day 1755 of the heart of the city of Lisbon by an earthquake, tidal wave and the urban fires that followed was a tragedy that divides the 18th century in Portugal. One casualty on that fatal morning was the Royal Library, one of the most magnificent libraries in Europe at the time. The Lost Library of the King of Portugal tells the story of the lost library &#x2013; its creation, collection and significance. <br><br>This 18th-century library was founded by the Bragan�a monarch Dom Jo�o V shortly after he came to the throne in 1706, and was housed at the heart of the royal palace, the Pa�o da Ribeira in Lisbon. The king&#x2019;s abiding ambition was to create one of Europe&#x2019;s great court libraries and, at the time of his death in 1750, it was reputed to be one of the most magnificent libraries in Europe. The Royal Library was also composed of a Cabinet of Prints and Drawings, medals and scientific instruments as well as a Cabinet of Natural History with specimens from across Portugal&#x2019;s global empire.<br><br>This documented study describes the creation of the library, its cultural significance in 18th-century Portugal, the acquisition of single volumes as well as entire libraries from across Europe and the role in this of Portugal&#x2019;s most talented diplomats. It include the collection of manuscripts from the celebrated library of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and the unpublished correspondence that was exchanged during the negotiations between London and Lisbon. Throughout his reign, the devout Dom Jo�o V set out to conjure up his own vision of Rome and the papal court he never saw. Two chapters are devoted to Italy &#x2013; one to the talented archaeologist Francesco Bianchini at the papal court, including the unpublished correspondence between him and his royal patron Dom Jo�o V, as well as the guides to Rome and art and architecture at the ducal courts of northern Italy, both commissioned by the king. <br><br>When the library was destroyed in 1 November 1755 by the earthquake, tidal wave and the fires that followed, only a few books, manuscripts and albums of prints were saved, and the author traces their final journey with the royal family and court to Brazil on the eve of the invasion by Napoleon&#x2019;s army in November 1806.</p><p></p><h2>Medieval Genealogy</h2><p>Genealogy has seen a phenomenal rise in popularity over the last decade. It constitutes the second most common use of the internet and local and family history societies are recording their highest membership totals ever. With its strong appeal to the sense of continuity, of personal and social identity and its ease of application to the information revolution, genealogy looks set to become the nation&#39;s favourite productive pastime. Many people consider themselves lucky to be able to trace their ancestors for more than a few generations back in time. However, as genealogical information becomes more organised and accessible, an increasing number of people find that they are able to go back not just a few generations but back to Tudor times and earlier. Until now there has been nothing to help the amateur genealogist research records before 1600 AD. Yet there is an enormous wealth of information from earlier than this just waiting to be accessed. Medieval Genealogy provides a clear and comprehensive account to the records available and the techniques needed to find and understand them. obvious gap in the genealogists&#39; library</p><p>Paul Chambers is a palaeontologist who spent three years with the BBC&#39;s Science unit, where he worked on Dinosaur Detectives&#39;, &#39;Walking With Dinosaurs&#39;, &#39;Walking With Beasts&#39; and &#39;The Lost World&#39;.

They called him in for photo opportunities. They called for comfort. They asked about death and salvation; about sin and forgiveness. <br><br>At a time when the nation is increasingly split over the place of religion in public life, THE PREACHER AND THE PRESIDENTS reveals how the world's most powerful men and world's most famous evangelist, Billy Graham, knit faith and politics together.</p><p>Nancy Gibbs was named a senior editor of Time (R) in October 1991, chief political writer in 1996, and Editor-at-Large in 2002. After moving to the Nation section, Gibbs wrote more than 20 cover stories on the 1996 and 2000 presidential campaigns, and in 1998, helped lead Time&#39;s coverage of the impeachment drama. Michael Duffy, most recently Time&#39;s Washington Bureau chief, has been at the centre of the magazine&#39;s coverage of politics and presidents for ten years. Duffy spent six years covering both the Bush and Clinton White House for Time and in 1995 won the Gerald R. Ford Award for Distinguished Reporting on the Presidency.The authors offer a chronological look at the Reverend Billy Grahams relationship with every president from Truman through Bush II. L.J. Ganser never loses his enthusiasm in his reading of the historical facts and anecdotes. He offers a consistent, clear Southern lilt when speaking for Graham, who has remained apolitical through the years. Grahams focus on his faith carries through as listeners learn how he stayed true in the face of a president who tried to use him for political purposes and another who didnt get along well with him. (One president had even sent him contributions as a boy.) Listeners will feel at ease as Ganser conveys the trust of the leaders in the preacher and the dignity of the reverend himself.

Alan Dundes&#39; theses identifies a strong anal erotic element in German national character, citing numerous examples of scatological data from authentic compilations of German folklore. The examination of this single trait of German character is used to demonstrate that national character exists and that its existence is unambiguously documented by the folklore of a nation. Dundes is of the opinion that the use of folkloristic data minimizes subjective bias in the study of national character, since unedited or uncensored, it constitutes a unique way of looking at a culture from the inside-out rather than from the outside-in, the more typical situation of an outside observer trying to understand a foreign culture.</p><p>A work of major importance that demonstrates the value of folklore for understanding national character.Alan Dundes is a professor of anthropology and folklore at the University of California at Berkeley.

His story, as presented in his Autobiography and the Life by Eunapius, is supplemented by information from a correspondence of over 1500 items and 64 extant orations. A native of Antioch, he began his teaching career in Constantinople in 340, but soon had to retire to Nicomedeia, where he became acquainted with St. Basil and influential in the development of Julian's paganism. After a second tenure at Constantinople he returned home to become professor in Antioch in 354, a position which he held, through many vicissitudes, for the rest of his life.</p><p>As sophist of Antioch and a devoted exponent of the traditional Hellenic system of education, Libanius remained deliberately and contemptuously unacquainted with Latin, and deplored its growing influence. Naturally humane in outlook and sympathizing with the local bourgeoisie, he criticized bitterly the encroachments and oppressions of the central administration, and the general cruelty of his day. Sincerely pagan in an increasingly aggressive Christian society, he became an influential voice against religious persecution, official or unofficial. The orations on Julian, to whose memory he remained devoted all his life, were composed between 362 and 365, and present Libanius with a congenial subject, revealing him at the height of his powers and influence.</p><p>Also available in the Loeb Classical Library is a two-volume edition of Libanius's <i>Autobiography and Selected Letters</i>.</p></p><p><p>Albert Francis Norman was Professor of Classics at the University of Hull.</p>&#x201c;Norman's command of his material is complete and remarkable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b></p><h2>The Book of Psalms:73-150 (The New Century Bible Commentary)</h2><p>Begins with Psalm 73 through ending.

Working both as an individual and with comrades--including Edward Abbey and Gary Snyder--he was part of an early coterie of counterculturalists and environmentalists who fought to thwart the plunder of natural resources in the Southwest. Loeffler, a former jazz musician, fire lookout, museum curator, bioregionalist, and self-taught aural historian, shares his humor and imagination, his adventures, observations, reflections, and meditations along the trail in his retelling of a life well lived. In this honest memoir, he advises each and every one of us to go skinny-dipping joyfully in the flow of Nature to better understand where we're headed.</p></p><p><strong>Jack Loeffler </strong>is an aural historian, environmentalist, writer, radio producer, and sound-collage artist.

Experiencing Seminole uprisings, Florida&#x2019;s burgeoning statehood, the Civil War, and the challenges of Reconstruction, Margaret holds her devoted family together with love, strength, and faith. Even the tragedy of seeing their beloved plantation on the St. John&#x2019;s River, Hibernia, destroyed twice, and having sons and husband pitted against each other in war cannot break Margaret&#x2019;s spirit or shake her faith. Her unconditional love, unflagging conviction in God, and contagious hope impact her descendants, a young state, and indeed a nation.From the Seminole uprisings to the Civil War, they fought for their bleoved plantation, their family, and their faith. . .Margaret Seton had loved the handsome young widower long before she become Lewis Fleming&#39;s bride. Together they would rebuild Hibernia on the St. Johns River in northern Florida, and fill it to overflowing with laughter and tears of their large, close-knit family. But nothing could have prepared them for the revages of war, the rampaging Seminoles, then the victorious Yankees plundering their cherished South, calling Margaret&#39;s husband and sons to battle, and her daughters to frightening new times. And above all, calling upon Margaret herself in this hour of need to become their wellspring of hope and faith.</p><h2>Beyond Eden</h2><p><b>Coulter at her romantic suspense best!</b><br><br> First published in 1992, <i>Beyond Eden</i> is the heart-stopping story of a successful New York City model who must face her deadly past when she meets a tough ex-cop turned private investigator.</p><p><b>Catherine Coulter</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the FBI Thrillers featuring husband and wife team Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock.

It could be her unloving father, hateful half-sister, the brother-in-law who once raped her, or her weirdo former professor. It probably isn't Taylor, the former cop who finally unlocks her passions and marries her. The solution of this mystery is one reason to keep listening to this overlong and overwritten novel. Deborah Hazlett's decent reading is another. Her voice is clear and, while she doesn't totally become each character, she leaves you in no doubt of each one's personality and motivations. Lindsay and Taylor's thoughts, fears, and erotic yearnings come at you ad nauseam, but that isn't the audio's fault. This capably presented story might actually be improved by abridgment.

From crossing the Red Sea to climbing Mount Sinai to touching the burning bush, Bruce Feiler's inspiring journey will forever change your view of some of history's most storied events. </p></p><p><i>Walking the Bible: A Journey by Land Through the Five Books of Moses</i> is the story of Bruce Feiler's 10,000-mile trek from Mount Ararat to Mount Nebo, undertaken for reasons he did not understand at the outset and accompanied by a companion who was very nearly a stranger. In the book's first chapter, in characteristically understated style, Feiler suggests a viable parallel to his journey: <blockquote>Abraham was not originally the man he became. He was not an Israelite, he was not a Jew. He was not even a believer in God--at least initially. He was a traveler, called by some voice not entirely clear that said: Go, head to this land, walk along this route, and trust what you will find.</blockquote><p> Feiler, a fifth-generation American Jew from the South, had felt no particular attachment to the Holy Land. Yet during his journey, Feiler's previously abstract faith grew more grounded. ("I began to feel a certain pull from the landscape.... It was a feeling of gravity. A feeling that I wanted to take off all my clothes and lie facedown in the soil.") Feiler's attentiveness, intelligence, and adventurousness enliven every page of this book. And the lessons he learned about the relationship between place and the spirit will be useful for readers of every religious tradition that finds its origins in the Bible. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><p>Bruce Feiler is the author of six consecutive <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, including <em>Abraham</em>, <em>Where God Was Born</em>, <em>America's Prophet</em>, <em>The Council of Dads</em>, and <em>The Secrets of Happy Families</em>.

In this graphic novel, Ferraris uses a bold charcoal technique to tell their story through the eyes of Gaetano Rizzo (based on a real U.S. soldier). A 22-year-old Sicilian immigrant, he joins the U.S. Army, who has promised him citizenship and a parcel of land if he will fight to take California away from Mexico. Soon, he sees sees the cruelty he is being ordered to inflict is no different from what he had escaped from in his home country.</p><p>Andrea Ferraris (b. 1966, Genoa, Italy) has worked for Disney for more than 20 years and also draws Donald Duck stories for the Danish publisher Egmont.

With the addition of a section on modern, synthetic rope in the 1970s, its popularity has continued undiminished to this day. It teaches a few basic knots--the bowline, sheet bend, and rolling hitch, among others--and splices in three-strand and braided rope. But its real business is decorative rope and canvaswork--the traditional arts of the sailor--and here it has no equal. For a rope mat, a rope ladder, a sea chest, a ditty bag, a canvas bucket, a mast boot, and the best-looking rope fenders or heaving line in the marina, this is the book of choice.</p><p><p><b>Hervey Garrett Smith</b> was a self-employed marine artist and writer.

Simply put, it ends in disaster. </p><p>Drawing on stories and examples from throughout modern political history-from Napoleon's invasion of Russia to the impending collapse of the American healthcare system, from the outbreak of WWII and the fall of the Third Reich to the 21st century War on Terror, from the Great Recession to the sovereign debt crisis-Bonner pursues a modest ambition: to understand what goes wrong. </p><p>History is not a clean yarn spun by its victors. It is a long tale of things that went FUBAR-debacles, disasters, and catastrophes. That each disaster carries with it a warning is what makes it useful to study. For instance, if the architect of a great ship tells you that 'not even God himself could sink this ship, ' you should take the next boat. If the stock market is selling at 20 times earnings and all the expert analysts urge you to 'get in' because you 'can't lose'-it's time to get out! </p><p>Similarly, public policy disasters are what you get when well meaning people with this same Titanic degree of certitude apply rational, small-scale problem-solving logic to inappropriately large scale planning. First, you get a declining rate of return on your investment (of time or resources) until you hit zero. Then, if you keep going through the zero floor-and you always keep going-you get a disaster. </p><p>The problem is, these disasters cannot be stopped by well-informed smart people with good intentions, because they are the people who cause them in the first place. </p><p>From the mind of Bill Bonner comes Hormegeddon, a phenomenon that occurs when a small dose of something produces a favorable result, but if you increase the dosage, the results end in disaster. The same applies when the world gets too much of a good thing in public policy, economics, and business. Drawing on examples throughout modern political history, Bonner brings context and understanding to this largely ignored and anonymous phenomenon.</p></p><p>Bill Bonner is the co-author of the New York Times Best Selling books Financial Reckoning Day: Surviving the Soft Depression of the 21st Century, Empire of Debt: The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis, and Mobs, Messiahs, and Markets: Surviving the Public Spectacle in Finance and Politics. He is also the founder and president of Agora Publishing and writes the daily financial newsletter Diary of a Rogue Economist. His daily letter is published in 4 countries and reaches more than 250,000 subscribers."This is a must, must, must read exposition of the side effect of government. It exposes the problem of naive interventionism, the iatrogenics of bureaucracies, and the growing absence of skin-in-the-game (Hammurabi's problem), in addition to the deformities of the modern state, and shows how such a system is bound to explode under the weight of fragility. It is deep, illustrative, witty, pleasant to read. Buy two copies, one for yourself, another for the nearest policy maker." - Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Distinguished Professor of Risk Engining, NYU, author of The Black Swan and Antifragile. <br><br>"I am seldom jealous of anybody, but I truly envy Bill Bonner's writing and intellectual skills. I read his notes every day because of his perfect prose and his deep insights into economics, and investment markets. But, Hormegeddon, is by far the best Bonner ever produced. It is funny, cynic, sarcastic, highly informative, beautifully written, entertaining, and most importantly, written by a man who is not afraid to tell the truth, and stand up for it. I do not say this often, but when I read his Hormegeddon, I was truly in awe." - Marc Faber, publisher of the Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report, director of investment advising firm Marc Faber Ltd.</p><h2>Warman&#39;s Transformers Field Guide: Identification and Values (Warman&#39;s Field Guide)</h2><p>Autobots and Decepticons manufactured between 1984-1990 are featured in a pocket-sized guide that includes five hundred color photographs that show these characters in their alternate modes, as well as identification details and up-to-date pricing.

Despite overwhelming odds, Edith survived the Holocaust and moved with her husband to the United States. Having worked in a factory whilst raising her young family, she went on to graduate with a PhD from the University of Texas and became an eminent psychologist. Today, she maintains a busy clinical practice and lectures around the world.The Choice CHAPTER 1<p></p> The Four Questions<p></p> <br>If I could distill my entire life into one moment, into one still image, it is this: three women in dark wool coats wait, arms linked, in a barren yard. They are exhausted. They&#x2019;ve got dust on their shoes. They stand in a long line.<br> <br>The three women are my mother, my sister Magda, and me. This is our last moment together. We don&#x2019;t know that. We refuse to consider it. Or we are too weary even to speculate about what is ahead. It is a moment of severing&#x2014;mother from daughters, life as it has been from all that will come after. And yet only hindsight can give it this meaning.<br> <br>I see the three of us from behind, as though I am next in line. Why does memory give me the back of my mother&#x2019;s head but not her face? Her long hair is intricately braided and clipped on top of her head. Magda&#x2019;s light brown waves touch her shoulders. My dark hair is tucked under a scarf. My mother stands in the middle and Magda and I both lean inward. It is impossible to discern if we are the ones who keep our mother upright, or if it is the other way around, her strength the pillar that supports Magda and me.<br> <br>This moment is a threshold into the major losses of my life. For seven decades I have returned again and again to this image of the three of us. I have studied it as though with enough scrutiny I can recover something precious. As though I can regain the life that precedes this moment, the life that precedes loss. As if there is such a thing.<br> <br>I have returned so that I can rest a little longer in this time when our arms are joined and we belong to one another. I see our sloped shoulders. The dust holding to the bottoms of our coats. My mother. My sister. Me.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Our childhood memories are often fragments, brief moments or encounters, which together form the scrapbook of our life. They are all we have left to understand the story we have come to tell ourselves about who we are.<br> <br>Even before the moment of our separation, my most intimate memory of my mother, though I treasure it, is full of sorrow and loss. We&#x2019;re alone in the kitchen, where she is wrapping up the leftover strudel that she made with dough I watched her cut by hand and drape like heavy linen over the dining room table. &#x201c;Read to me,&#x201d; she says, and I fetch the worn copy of Gone with the Wind from her bedside table. We have read it through once before. Now we have begun again. I pause over the mysterious inscription, written in English, on the title page of the translated book. It&#x2019;s in a man&#x2019;s handwriting, but not my father&#x2019;s. All that my mother will say is that the book was a gift from a man she met when she worked at the Foreign Ministry before she knew my father.<br> <br>We sit in straight-backed chairs near the woodstove. I read this grown-up novel fluently despite the fact that I am only nine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you have brains because you have no looks,&#x201d; she has told me more than once, a compliment and a criticism intertwined. She can be hard on me. But I savor this time. When we read together, I don&#x2019;t have to share her with anyone else. I sink into the words and the story and the feeling of being alone in a world with her. Scarlett returns to Tara at the end of the war to learn her mother is dead and her father is far gone in grief. &#x201c;As God is my witness,&#x201d; Scarlett says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m never going to be hungry again.&#x201d; My mother has closed her eyes and leans her head against the back of the chair. I want to climb into her lap. I want to rest my head against her chest. I want her to touch her lips to my hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tara ...&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;America, now that would be a place to see.&#x201d; I wish she would say my name with the same softness she reserves for a country where she&#x2019;s never been. All the smells of my mother&#x2019;s kitchen are mixed up for me with the drama of hunger and feast&#x2014;always, even in the feast, that longing. I don&#x2019;t know if the longing is hers or mine or something we share.<br> <br>We sit with the fire between us.<br> <br>&#x201c;When I was your age ...&#x201d; she begins.<br> <br>Now that she is talking, I am afraid to move, afraid she won&#x2019;t continue if I do.<br> <br>&#x201c;When I was your age, the babies slept together and my mother and I shared a bed. One morning I woke up because my father was calling to me, &#x2018;Ilonka, wake up your mother, she hasn&#x2019;t made breakfast yet or laid out my clothes.&#x2019; I turned to my mother next to me under the covers. But she wasn&#x2019;t moving. She was dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>She has never told me this before. I want to know every detail about this moment when a daughter woke beside a mother she had already lost. I also want to look away. It is too terrifying to think about.<br> <br>&#x201c;When they buried her that afternoon, I thought they had put her in the ground alive. That night, Father told me to make the family supper. So that&#x2019;s what I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wait for the rest of the story. I wait for the lesson at the end, or the reassurance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bedtime,&#x201d; is all my mother says. She bends to sweep the ash under the stove.<br> <br>Footsteps thump down the hall outside our door. I can smell my father&#x2019;s tobacco even before I hear the jangle of his keys.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies,&#x201d; he calls, &#x201c;are you still awake?&#x201d; He comes into the kitchen in his shiny shoes and dapper suit, his big grin, a little sack in his hand that he gives me with a loud kiss to the forehead. &#x201c;I won again,&#x201d; he boasts. Whenever he plays cards or billiards with his friends, he shares the spoils with me. Tonight he&#x2019;s brought a petit four laced in pink icing. If I were my sister Magda, my mother, always concerned about Magda&#x2019;s weight, would snatch the treat away, but she nods at me, giving me permission to eat it.<br> <br>She is standing now, on her way from the fire to the sink. My father intercepts her, lifts her hand so he can twirl her around the room, which she does, stiffly, without a smile. He pulls her in for an embrace, one hand on her back, one teasing at her breast. My mother shrugs him away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a disappointment to your mother,&#x201d; my father half whispers to me as we leave the kitchen. Does he intend for her to overhear, or is this a secret meant only for me? Either way, it is something I store away to mull over later. Yet the bitterness in his voice scares me. &#x201c;She wants to go to the opera every night, live some fancy cosmopolitan life. I&#x2019;m just a tailor. A tailor and a billiards player.&#x201d;<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s defeated tone confuses me. He is well known in our town, and well liked. Playful, smiling, he always seems comfortable and alive. He&#x2019;s fun to be around. He goes out with his many friends. He loves food (especially the ham he sometimes smuggles into our kosher household, eating it over the newspaper it was wrapped in, pushing bites of forbidden pork into my mouth, enduring my mother&#x2019;s accusations that he is a poor role model). His tailor shop has won two gold medals. He isn&#x2019;t just a maker of even seams and straight hems. He is a master of couture. That&#x2019;s how he met my mother&#x2014;she came into his shop because she needed a dress and his work came so highly recommended. But he had wanted to be a doctor, not a tailor, a dream his father had discouraged, and every once in a while his disappointment in himself surfaces.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not just a tailor, Papa,&#x201d; I reassure him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best tailor!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re going to be the best-dressed lady in Ko&#x161;ice,&#x201d; he tells me, patting my head. &#x201c;You have the perfect figure for couture.&#x201d;<br> <br>He seems to have remembered himself. He&#x2019;s pushed his disappointment back into the shadows. We reach the door to the bedroom I share with Magda and our middle sister, Klara, where I can picture Magda pretending to do homework and Klara wiping rosin dust off her violin. My father and I stand in the doorway a moment longer, neither one of us quite ready to break away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted you to be a boy, you know,&#x201d; my father says. &#x201c;I slammed the door when you were born, I was that mad at having another girl. But now you&#x2019;re the only one I can talk to.&#x201d; He kisses my forehead.<br> <br>I love my father&#x2019;s attention. Like my mother&#x2019;s, it is precious ... and precarious. As though my worthiness of their love has less to do with me and more to do with their loneliness. As though my identity isn&#x2019;t about anything that I am or have and only a measure of what each of my parents is missing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good night, Dicuka,&#x201d; my father says at last. He uses the pet name my mother invented for me. Ditzu-ka. These nonsense syllables are warmth to me. &#x201c;Tell your sisters it&#x2019;s time for lights out.&#x201d;<br> <br>As I come into the bedroom, Magda and Klara greet me with the song they have invented for me. They made it up when I was three and one of my eyes became crossed in a botched medical procedure. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so ugly, you&#x2019;re so puny,&#x201d; they sing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never find a husband.&#x201d; Since the accident I turn my head toward the ground when I walk so that I don&#x2019;t have to see anyone looking at my lopsided face. I haven&#x2019;t yet learned that the problem isn&#x2019;t that my sisters taunt me with a mean song; the problem is that I believe them. I am so convinced of my inferiority that I never introduce myself by name. I never tell people, &#x201c;I am Edie.&#x201d; Klara is a violin prodigy. She mastered the Mendelssohn violin concerto when she was five. &#x201c;I am Klara&#x2019;s sister,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>But tonight I have special knowledge. &#x201c;Mama&#x2019;s mom died when she was exactly my age,&#x201d; I tell them. I am so certain of the privileged nature of this information that it doesn&#x2019;t occur to me that for my sisters this is old news, that I am the last and not the first to know.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding,&#x201d; Magda says, her voice full of sarcasm so obvious that even I can recognize it. She is fifteen, busty, with sensual lips, wavy hair. She is the jokester in our family. When we were younger, she showed me how to drop grapes out of our bedroom window into the coffee cups of the patrons sitting on the patio below. Inspired by her, I will soon invent my own games; but by then, the stakes will have changed. My girlfriend and I will sashay up to boys at school or on the street. &#x201c;Meet me at four o&#x2019;clock by the clock on the square,&#x201d; we will trill, batting our eyelashes. They will come, they will always come, sometimes giddy, sometimes shy, sometimes swaggering with expectation. From the safety of my bedroom, my friend and I will stand at the window and watch the boys arrive.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tease so much,&#x201d; Klara snaps at Magda now. She is younger than Magda, but she jumps in to protect me. &#x201c;You know that picture above the piano?&#x201d; she says to me. &#x201c;The one that Mama&#x2019;s always talking to? That&#x2019;s her mother.&#x201d; I know the picture she&#x2019;s talking about. I&#x2019;ve looked at it every day of my life. &#x201c;Help me, help me,&#x201d; our mother moans up at the portrait as she dusts the piano, sweeps the floor. I feel embarrassed that I have never asked my mother&#x2014;or anyone&#x2014;who was in that picture. And I&#x2019;m disappointed that my information gives me no special status with my sisters.<br> <br>I am used to being the silent sister, the invisible one. It doesn&#x2019;t occur to me that Magda might tire of being the clown, that Klara might resent being the prodigy. She can&#x2019;t stop being extraordinary, not for a second, or everything might be taken from her&#x2014;the adoration she&#x2019;s accustomed to, her very sense of self. Magda and I have to work at getting something we are certain there will never be enough of; Klara has to worry that at any moment she might make a fatal mistake and lose it all. Klara has been playing violin all my life, since she was three. It&#x2019;s not until much later that I realize the cost of her extraordinary talent: she gave up being a child. I never saw her play with dolls. Instead she stood in front of an open window to practice violin, not able to enjoy her creative genius unless she could summon an audience of passersby to witness it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does Mama love Papa?&#x201d; I ask my sisters now. The distance between our parents, the sad things they have each confessed to me, remind me that I have never seen them dressed up to go out together.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a question,&#x201d; Klara says. Though she denies my concern, I think I see a recognition in her eyes. We will never discuss it again, though I will try. It will take me years to learn what my sisters must already know, that what we call love is often something more conditional&#x2014;the reward for a performance, what you settle for.<br> <br>As we put on our nightgowns and get into bed, I erase my worry for my parents and think instead of my ballet master and his wife, of the feeling I get when I take the steps up to the studio two or three at a time and kick off my school clothes, pull on my leotard and tights. I have been studying ballet since I was five years old, since my mother intuited that I wasn&#x2019;t a musician, that I had other gifts. Just today we practiced the splits. Our ballet master reminded us that strength and flexibility are inseparable&#x2014;for one muscle to flex, another must open; to achieve length and limberness, we have to hold our cores strong.<br> <br>I hold his instructions in my mind like a prayer. Down I go, spine straight, abdominal muscles tight, legs stretching apart. I know to breathe, especially when I feel stuck. I picture my body expanding like the strings on my sister&#x2019;s violin, finding the exact place of tautness that makes the whole instrument ring. And I am down. I am here. In the full splits. &#x201c;Brava!&#x201d; My ballet master claps. &#x201c;Stay right as you are.&#x201d; He lifts me off the ground and over his head. It&#x2019;s hard to keep my legs fully extended without the floor to push against, but for a moment I feel like an offering. I feel like pure light. &#x201c;Editke,&#x201d; my teacher says, &#x201c;all your ecstasy in life is going to come from the inside.&#x201d; It will take me years to really understand what he means. For now all I know is that I can breathe and spin and kick and bend. As my muscles stretch and strengthen, every movement, every pose seems to call out: I am, I am, I am. I am me. I am somebody.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Memory is sacred ground. But it&#x2019;s haunted too. It&#x2019;s the place where my rage and guilt and grief go circling like hungry birds scavenging the same old bones. It&#x2019;s the place where I go searching for the answer to the unanswerable question: Why did I survive?<br> <br>I am seven years old, and my parents are hosting a dinner party. They send me out of the room to refill a pitcher of water. From the kitchen I hear them joke, &#x201c;We could have saved that one.&#x201d; I think they mean that before I came along they were already a complete family. They had a daughter who played piano and a daughter who played violin. I am unnecessary, I am not good enough, there is no room for me, I think. This is the way we misinterpret the facts of our lives, the way we assume and don&#x2019;t check it out, the way we invent a story to tell ourselves, reinforcing the very thing in us we already believe.<br> <br>One day when I am eight, I decide to run away. I will test the theory that I am dispensable, invisible. I will see if my parents even know that I am gone. Instead of going to school, I take the trolley to my grandparents&#x2019; house. I trust my grandparents&#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s father and stepmother&#x2014;to cover for me. They engage in a continuous war with my mother on Magda&#x2019;s behalf, hiding cookies in my sister&#x2019;s dresser drawer. They are safety to me, and yet they sanction the forbidden. They hold hands, something my own parents never do. There&#x2019;s no performing for their love, no pretending for their approval. They are comfort&#x2014;the smell of brisket and baked beans, of sweet bread, of cholent, a rich stew that my grandmother brings to the bakery to cook on Sabbath, when Orthodox practice does not permit her to use her own oven.<br> <br>My grandparents are happy to see me. It is a wonderful morning. I sit in the kitchen, eating nut rolls...</p><h2>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)</h2><p>The feats of the British Navy are known and celebrated world-wide. The force that crushed the Armada in 1588 and defeated the French at Trafalgar in 1805 had a profound impact on world affairs for well nigh two centuries. More than this, it worked its way deep into the national psyche--as seen in the words to <em>Rule, Britannia</em>--not only through its many great exploits, but through the reputation of the ordinary sailors for courage, enterprise, tenacity, and humor.<br> Written by an international team of experts, this lavishly illustrated volume--boasting more than 200 pictures, including sixteen pages of color plates--provides a superb chronicle of the Royal Navy's glorious history. Everything is here--from the building of the <em>Mary Rose</em>, the first great man-of-war, sunk in 1545 (and recently rediscovered); to the Elizabethan navy led by such adventurers as Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins; to the defeat of the Spanish Armada and the great sea battles at Leghorn and Scheveningen and Trafalgar; to the great admirals, such as Robert Blake, the finest seaman of the commonwealth period, and of course Horatio Nelson, the greatest fighting officer in the history of the Royal Navy. Throughout, the contributors illuminate the Navy's evolving strategy, operations, ship and weapon construction, organization, manning, training, and status in society from medieval times to the present day. And they take great care to place this stirring history against the social, economic, and political climate of the time. There is even a fascinating look at the Royal Navy's role in exploration and discovery, from the great scientific voyages of Captain James Cook, to the travels of the <em>Beagle</em> to the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia, with Charles Darwin on board.<br> <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy</em> recounts in vivid r laoudone magnificent achievements of the world's most famous Navy. It is an essential volume for anyone interested in maritime or military history.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>Rear-Admiral J. R. Hill</strong> served for over 40 years in the Royal Navy in sea and Whitehall appointments, ending his career in 1983. He has written six books on maritime warfare, strategy, and arms control, and lectures world-wide on these areas. He is editor of <em>The Naval Review</em> and Chairman of the Society for Nautical Research. <strong>Bryan Ranft</strong>, Consultant Editor, is a Former Professor of History at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.<br>This eponymous complement to <i>The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army</i> doesn't quite sing "Rule Britannia," but it does lavishly chronicle the many-centuried saga whereby that patriotic anthem's assertion became indisputable. Such at least was the case during Britain's nineteenth-century apogee, a period of somnolent superiority until imperial Germany constructed its fleet. Each of a dozen such phases or aspects in the Royal Navy's development receives the attention of a historian whose uncommon depth, combined with fluid generalizing, disproves Churchill's dismissal of Royal Navy tradition as nothing but "rum, buggery, and the lash." Broadly, the editors have sent their authors after the subjects of naval architecture (from galleon to nuclear sub), naval personnel and bureaucracy (from piracy to professionalism), and voyages and battles (from the Armada to the Falklands). Backed by hundreds of images, the chapters interlock to describe an evolving institution punctuated by famous dramas, such as Cook's voyages or the Battle of Trafalgar, undergirded by the year-to-year chore of funding and crewing vessels. A volume of balance between perspective and detail that delights and informs the nautically minded. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>News from Tartary</h2><p>Peter Fleming&#39;s account of his 1935 bid to travel the ancient trade route from China to India known as the &#39;Silk Road&#39;.</p><p>9 1.5-hour cassettes<p>Peter Fleming is an invasive species specialist with 28 years experience in research at the Vertebrate Pest Research Unit of the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSWDPI).</p></p><h2>No Onion No Garlic</h2><p>p In the Indian way of classification foods are grouped into three categories - sattvic goodness equanimity rajasic passion stimulants and tamasic ignorance sedative Onions and garlic classified as rajasic and tamasic are supposed to increase passion and ignorance p p For those who subscribe to pure Brahmana style of cooking this is the book to possess Easy to cook with delectable recipes for every meal be it breakfast lunch tea or dinner No Onion No Garlic gives you fresh recipes as well as regular favorites with new permutations p p Add this compilation to your collection of recipe books Enjoy foods fit to offer a God p</p><p></p><h2>Moscow to Stalingrad: Decision in the East (Army Historical Series)</h2><p>&#x201c;Moscow to Stalingrad: Decision in the East&#x201d; is the second to be completed in a projected three-volume history of the German-Soviet conflict in World War II. The first, &#x201c;Stalingrad to Berlin: The German Defeat in the East&#x201d;, covered the Soviet Army's liberation of its own territory and its drive across central and southeastern Europe. In the present volume, the German and Soviet forces initially confront each other on the approaches to Moscow, Leningrad, and Rostov in the late-1941 battles that produced the first major German setbacks of the war and gave the Soviet troops their first tastes of success. Later, the pendulum swings to the Germans' side, and their armies race across the Ukraine and into the Caucasus during the summer of 1942. In the course of a year, the Soviet Command goes from offensive to defensive and, finally, at Stalingrad, decisively to the offensive- meanwhile, frequently in desperate circumstances, building the strength and proficiency mat will enable it to mount the relentless thrusts of the succeeding years. In tracing the shifting Soviet and German fortunes, the author has had full access to the German military records, most of which fell into American and British hands. He has also made extensive use of the Soviet war histories, memoirs, and periodical literature. The result is both a panorama of battles, among them some of the greatest in the history of warfare, and an inquiry into the forces in war that shape and test the military power of nations.</p><p></p><h2>The Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s Manual: A History of Terror in the Name of God</h2><p><p><i>The Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s Manual </i>by nationally bestselling author Jonathan Kirsch is a provocative popular history of the Inquisition, the 12th century reign of church-sanctioned terror. Ranging from the Knights Templar to the first Protestants, from Joan of Arc to Galileo, <i>The Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s Manual </i>is a fascinating and sobering study of the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of &#x201c;heretics&#x201d; in God&#x2019;s name&#x2014;the original blueprints for persecution originally drafted in the Middle Ages but followed for centuries afterwards, up to and including the &#x201c;advanced interrogation methods&#x201d; recently employed at Guantanamo Bay.</p></p><p><blockquote><p><em>"The inquisitorial apparatus that was first invented in the Middle Ages remained in operation for the next six-hundred years, and it has never been wholly dismantled. As we shall see, an unbroken thread links the friar-inquisitors who set up the rack and the pyre in southern France in the early thirteenth century to the torturers and executioners of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia in the mid-twentieth century. Nor does the thread stop at Auschwitz or the Gulag; it can be traced through the Salem witch trials in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the Hollywood blacklists of the McCarthy era, and even the interrogation cells at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo."</em></p></blockquote><p>The twelfth century birthed a new and sinister brand of sanctioned terror, an international network of secret police and courts, an army of inquisitors whose sworn duty was to seek out anyone regarded as an enemy, and a casualty list numbering in the tens of thousands. The original agents of the Inquisition&#x2014;priests and monks, scribes and notaries, attorneys and accountants, torturers and executioners&#x2014;were deputized by the Church and their worst excesses were excused as the pardonable sins of soldiers engaged in a holy war against heresy that became the obsession of Christendom. Yet the first rumblings of Western civilization's great engine of persecution provided no indication of the ultimate scope and influence of the inquisitorial toolkit and how the crimes of the first inquisitors were perpetrated again and again into the twentieth century and beyond. Despite the importance of this legacy, the history of the Inquisition remains a subject that has largely been overlooked by general historians.</p><p>With <em>The Grand Inquisitor's Manual</em>, national bestselling author Jonathan Kirsch delivers a sweeping and provocative history that explores how the Inquisition was honed to perfection and brought to bear on an ever-widening circle of victims by authoritarians in both church and state for over six hundred years. Ranging from the Knights Templar to the first Protestants, from Joan of Arc to Galileo; from the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent women during the Witch Craze to its greatest power in Spain after 1492, when the secret tribunals and torture chambers were directed for the first time against Jews and Muslims to the modern war on terror&#x2014;Kirsch shows us how the Inquisition stands as a universal and ineradicable symbol of the terror that results when absolute power works its corruptions.</p><p>The history of the Inquisition is draped in myth and mystery, a favorite theme of both artists and propagandists throughout the six hundred years of its active operations. Yet when we pull aside the veil, what we see are the original blueprints for the machinery of persecution that was invented in the High Middle Ages and applied to human flesh ever since. <em>The Grand Inquisitor's Manual</em> exposes the dangerous circular logic of the Inquisition so that we do not perpetuate its brand of terror.</p><p>Jonathan Kirsch is the author of ten books, including the national bestseller <em>The Harlot by the Side of the Road</em> and his most recent work, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> bestseller <em>A History of the End of the World</em>. Kirsch is also a book columnist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, a broadcaster for NPR affiliates in Southern California, and an adjunct professor at New York University.</p></p><h2>Caroline (Sunfire)</h2><p>When Caroline&#39;s brothers head West to find gold in California, she disguises herself as a boy and follows, but along the way she meets Dan Riddle and falls in love</p><p></p><h2>Lab Girl</h2><p><b>An illuminating debut memoir of a woman in science; a moving portrait of a long-time collaboration, in work and in life; and a stunningly fresh look at plants that will forever change how you see and think about the natural world.</b><br>Acclaimed scientist Hope Jahren has built three laboratories in which she's studied trees, flowers, seeds, and soil. Her first book might have been a revelatory treatise on plant life. <i>Lab Girl</i> is that, but it is also so much more. Because in it, Jahren also shares with us her inspiring life story, in prose that takes your breath away. <br><i>Lab Girl</i> is a book about work, about love, and about the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren's remarkable stories: about the things she's discovered in her lab, as well as how she got there; about her childhood--hours of unfettered play in her father's laboratory; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work "with both the heart and the hands"; about a brilliant and wounded man named Bill, who became her loyal colleague and best friend; about their adventurous, sometimes rogue research trips, which take them from the Midwest all across the United States and over the Atlantic, from the ever-light skies of the North Pole to tropical Hawaii; and about her constant striving to do and be the best she could, never allowing personal or professional obstacles to cloud her dedication to her work. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jahren's insights on nature enliven every page of this book. <i>Lab Girl</i> allows us to see with clear eyes the beautiful, sophisticated mechanisms within every leaf, blade of grass, and flower petal, and also the power within ourselves to face--with bravery and conviction--life's ultimate challenge: discovering who you are.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2016:</strong> I was doubtful that I would like this book. While I appreciate a beautiful flower as much as the next city-girl, the thought of reading a whole book about a geobiologist-- a scientist who spends her life studying plants, trees, soils as well as flowers--made me want to run to the nearest dysfunctional family memoir about crazy parents and their wounded children. But Hope Jahren won me over very quickly. Somehow she knows me: &#x201c;the average person [who] cannot imagine himself staring at dirt for longer than the twenty seconds needed to pick up whatever object he just dropped.&#x201d; And she doesn&#x2019;t judge. Instead, she just tells her story, which, it turns out has a lot to do with plants and science, of course--her father was a scientist, she basically grew up in a lab, and taking long walks through nature was the way she communed with her reticent Scandinavian American parents--but also has a lot to do with other things. Like life, for instance, and friendship and passion and love, for ideas, for work and for all living beings, including--shocker!--people. Surely many readers will feel as I did that the story of her relationship with Bill, her physically and emotionally damaged lab partner, is at the heart of this wonderful story; it&#x2019;s unusual, it&#x2019;s inspiring and it doesn&#x2019;t fit neatly into the little window box we think we&#x2019;re supposed to favor. And if Jahren can surprise you about all that messy human stuff, just think how she can change your feelings about dirt. <em>--Sara Nelson</em>HOPE JAHREN is an award-winning scientist who has been pursuing independent research in paleobiology since 1996, when she completed her PhD at UC Berkeley and began teaching and researching first at the Georgia Institute of Technology and then at Johns Hopkins University.

Enthralled by its windswept beauty, they soon were the proud owners of a near-derelict croft house&#x2014;a farmer&#x2019;s stone cottage&#x2014;on &#x201c;a small acre&#x201d; of land. Mary assumed duties as the island&#x2019;s district nurse.<i> Call the Nurse</i> is her account of the enchanted years she and her family spent there, coming to know its folk as both patients and friends.<br><br> In anecdotes that are by turns funny, sad, moving, and tragic, she recalls them all, the crofters and their laird, the boatmen and tradesmen, young lovers and forbidding churchmen.

For reasons which will be evident in what follows, the main body of the work (chapters 3 through 11) will focus on the Democratic party and the labor movement of California through the forty-year period after the Civil War. The two opening chapters turn back to explore aspects of the Jacksonian background which appear crucial to an understanding of what occurred in California. The final chapter looks beyond the turn of the century to trace certain results of the sequence of events in the West for the labor movement as a whole, and to suggest the influence of those events upon the crystallization of an American concept of national identity.</p><p>"An eloquent and meticulous history of race and class which is as exciting today as when it first appeared."--David Roediger, Professor of History, University of Minnesota&nbsp;"Saxton's path-breaking study continues to underscore the significant of race in the American politics and culture--a timely critical perspective for the 21st century."--Ronald Takaki, author of <i>A Different Mirror</i>&nbsp;"No one interested in the intersection of race, class, and ideology can neglect this book.

That alone merits a memoir. In addition to his ball-playing credentials--he finished just a few wins short of the 300 that would surely have won him a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame--Kaat also served as a coach under the now infamous Pete Rose, and for nearly a decade he has worked as a broadcaster for the New York Yankees. If at times a bit biased in favor of the ballplayers from his heyday (the 1960s), Kaat proves an affable tour guide to the world of big-league baseball. He's insightful when discussing what it was like to work with Rose as the latter's gambling problems worsened, and he offers interesting tidbits on current Yankees and other major-league stars such as Barry Bonds. This is not a tell-all book; there's little in the way of dirt or gossip but plenty of strong and learned opinion from a lifelong student of the game. <i>Kevin Canfield</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Four days before Halloween, a pumpkin with a "wicked grin" and no other facial features appears in Mrs. McMurphy's hallway. It threatens her, "When my teeth are here, I'll eat you," but she refuses to be cowed and carries it outside. The pumpkin mysteriously reappears inside her house on each of the following days, first with a "crooked nose" to add to the grin, then "two pointy ears," then "two mean eyes." Each time, it repeats its warning and the woman responds by sending it farther and farther away. Finally, on Halloween, the pumpkin returns once more, complete with "large, sharp teeth," and declares that it's ready to eat her. Mrs. McMurphy calmly replies, "We'll have to see about that," and ends up making a pie and serving delicious slices to her trick-or-treaters. Walton uses lots of repetition that invites young listeners to chant along. Done in gouache and acrylics, the folkloric illustrations are dominated by orange tones and filled with wonderful details. This is sure to be a Halloween favorite.<i>&#x2013;Jane Marino, Bronxville Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You&#39;ll find Log Cabin blocks, chevrons, stacked Chinese Coins, and more, yet they don&#39;t look like the same old patterns. By focusing on rectangular blocks, Ilene Bartos has created 12 refreshing designs. Easy enough for confident beginners, these quilts offer plenty of appeal for advanced quilters as well.</p><p>Ilene Bartos studied art in college and has found quilting to be the perfect creative outlet. She has displayed her quilts in various shows and won numerous awards. She enjoys sharing her passion for quilting with others. <br><br>Home: Urbandale, IowaI love quilters that have a sense of color and Ilene has oodles of it. Twelve quilts from simple shapes include Log Cabin and stacked Chinese Coins, simple rectangles all in beautiful colors. The book includes quiltmaking basics, templates, easy to follow instructions, and good line drawings and photography. I love Autumn Paths and Treasure Boxes. Recommended. --Karen Platt, book reviewer, karenplatt.co.uk<br><br>These pieced projects include bed quilts in a range of sizes, lap quilts, and large wall hangings. This presents dazzling quilts made from rectangles, strips, and easy triangles. It offers fresh, vibrant interpretations of old pieced favorites, such as the Log Cabin, Basketweave, and stacked Chinese Coins. One design features appliqued flowers. Very suitable for beginners, these quilts are too beautiful to hide away in bedrooms. They deserve the place of honor in an entryway or living area.<br><br>For each quilt this has a list of fabrics, a cutting chart, and layouts. There are easy to follow, color-illustrated instructions for strip piecing the blocks along with directions on completing the quilt top and finishing the quilt. This also has suggested quilting designs and full size templates. It covers all of the quilting basics from applique and embroidery to binding the edges. --Connie Krochmal, quilting.suite101.com<br><br>Ilene Bartos' book <i>Spectacular Rectangles</i> is truly amazing! I opened the book and when I looked at the photos of the quilts I couldn't decide which one was more beautiful. There are the braided golds in "Autumn Paths," the bright colors in "Chains of Hope" or the intricate woven work which appears so complex in "Basket Weave." Bartos uses an extensive variety of batiks to create quilts which are stunning, but also utilizes whimsical fabrics in quilts like "Safari" to create a totally different mood. <br><br>The quilts are made from simple shapes, arranged to make spectacular quilts. Following the clear directions even a relatively inexperienced quilter can create visually complex and beautiful quilts. This is a book is a keeper. --Karin Renaud, Quilt Designer<br><br>At last, a quilt book that takes the beginner onto the next level. This book is great for those quilters who are looking for a challenge and the chance to create something unique and unpredictable. There are heaps of quilt books available for the learning, just starting out quilter and a few that are available for the consummate quilter who has the skills for the advanced quiltmaking. There are not a lot of books that take the beginner and guide them through the intricate up-skilling that is required to be comfortable in the next level.<br><br>The basic design challenge of each of the twelve quilts is the humble rectangle. Ilene has explored various ways of setting these shapes together, but with a really unique twist. Ilene has incorporated regular patchwork shapes such as Drunkards Path, Log Cabin and French Braid into the unusual rectangular setting. The results are some of the most stunning quilts I have ever seen.<br><br>The fact that Ilene uses mostly Batiks probably influences my delight of these quilts. I just love Batik fabrics and the possibilities of what you can do with them. The photographs in this publication are fantastic, as well as the simple and clear instructions. Ilene has taken the time to break each skill component into simple steps that can be easily understood. I particularly like the way she describes the fabrics and the easy cutting tables.<br><br>I like that Ilene has featured some of the special skills required, for instance a great set of instructions and diagrams for sewing curved seams. One doesn t need to refer to other quilt books for techniques. Ilene has got them all covered in this great publication. I thoroughly recommend this wonderful quilt book to the quilter who is looking to step up their skills and make a truly unique quilt. --BellaOnline.com<br><br>Ilene Bartos' book <i>Spectacular Rectangles</i> is truly amazing!

When Captain Leonard La Rue spied from his twelve-man merchant ship, the Meredith Victory, the throng of Korean refugees on the docks of a city in flames, he didn't hesitate to do what others would consider impossible. In December of 1950, La Rue and his skeleton crew rescued fourteen thousand Korean refugees from the hands of the rapidly-approaching Chinese army in the city of Hungnam. Through the night and next day, a seemingly endless succession of refugees boarded the Meredith, their will to live and strong spirit steeling them against the bitter cold and incredibly crowded conditions. Standing shoulder to shoulder for three days the refugees and crew stoically endured as La Rue steered the ship through sea battle, a thirty-mile web of sea mines, and enemy shelling. <i>Ship of Miracles</i> is the incredible story of what has been called "the greatest rescue operation by a single ship in the history of mankind." Against all odds, the little merchant vessel transported its precious cargo to the island of Koje-Do on Christmas Eve completely unharmed, all fourteen thousand refugees alive and well, including an additional five new lives begun on this incredible journey. As the fiftieth anniversary of this miraculous rescue approaches, <i>Ship of Miracles</i> is as touching today as it was then; a tale you'll hold close to your heart, and return to time and again. While the United States Navy prepares to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the perilous evacuation at Hungnam and honor the Meredith Victory's miraculous feat, read this never-before-told account from the crew themselves, as they relate the incredible and unbelievable details of their three-day journey from fear to freedom.</p><p>Gilbert is a former reporter for the Washington Post.<br><br>Haig is former U.S. Secretary of State.</p><h2>Stories Boys Who Dare To Be Different</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Ben Brooks (Author) Ben Brooks was born in 1992 and lives in Berlin.

This illustrated version for children shows how the humble comma can change the meaning of a sentence completely. You might want to eat a huge hot dog, but a huge, hot dog would run away pretty quickly if you tried to take a bite out of him. 'Children Drive Slowly' on a road-sign doesn't quite sum up what kids do in their spare time. And we all know now that the comma in 'Eats shoots and leaves' is a crucial one. Lynne Truss and Bonnie Timmons illuminate the hilarious confusion that one mere dot with a tail can cause, in this follow-up to the number one best-seller "Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves" - which this time features lively and subversive pictures by one of America's leading illustrators. This picture book is sure to elicit gales of laughter and better punctuation from all who read it.</p><p>Lynne Truss is a writer and journalist who started out as a literary editor with a blue pencil and then got sidetracked. The author of three novels and numerous radio comedy dramas, she spent six years as the television critic of <i>The Times of London</i>, followed by four (rather peculiar) years as a sports columnist for the same newspaper. She won Columnist of the Year for her work for Women&#x2019;s Journal. Lynne Truss also hosted Cutting a Dash, a popular BBC Radio 4 series about punctuation. She now reviews books for the Sunday Times of London and is a familiar voice on BBC Radio 4. She lives in Brighton, England.<br>BONNIE TIMMONS is best known for inspiring and creating images for the television show <i>Caroline in the City</i> and illustrating numerous national ad campaigns.<b>Introduction &#x2013; The Seventh Sense</b> <br><br>Either this will ring bells for you, or it won&#x2019;t. A printed banner has appeared on the concourse of a petrol station near to where I live. &#x201c;Come inside,&#x201d; it says, &#x201c;for CD&#x2019;s, VIDEO&#x2019;s, DVD&#x2019;s, and BOOK&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>If this satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put down this book at once. By all means congratulate yourself that you are not a pedant or even a stickler; that you are happily equipped to live in a world of plummeting punctuation standards; but just don&#x2019;t bother to go any further. For any true stickler, you see, the sight of the plural word &#x201c;Book&#x2019;s&#x201d; with an apostrophe in it will trigger a ghastly private emotional process similar to the stages of bereavement, though greatly accelerated. First there is shock. Within seconds, shock gives way to disbelief, disbelief to pain, and pain to anger. Finally (and this is where the analogy breaks down), anger gives way to a righteous urge to perpetrate an act of criminal damage with the aid of a permanent marker.<br><br>It&#x2019;s tough being a stickler for punctuation these days. One almost dare not get up in the mornings. True, one occasionally hears a marvellous punctuation-fan joke about a panda who &#x201c;eats, shoots and leaves&#x201d;, but in general the stickler&#x2019;s exquisite sensibilities are assaulted from all sides, causing feelings of panic and isolation. A sign at a health club will announce, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ts party time, on Saturday 24th May we are have a disco/party night for free, it will be a ticket only evening.&#x201d; Advertisements offer decorative services to &#x201c;wall&#x2019;s &#x2013; ceiling&#x2019;s &#x2013; door&#x2019;s ect&#x201d;. Meanwhile a newspaper placard announces &#x201c;FAN&#x2019;S FURY AT STADIUM INQUIRY&#x201d;, which sounds quite interesting until you look inside the paper and discover that the story concerns a quite large mob of fans, actually &#x2013; not just the lone hopping-mad fan so promisingly indicated by the punctuation.<br><br>Everywhere one looks, there are signs of ignorance and indifference. What about that film Two Weeks Notice? Guaranteed to give sticklers a very nasty turn, that was &#x2013; its posters slung along the sides of buses in letters four feet tall, with no apostrophe in sight. I remember, at the start of the Two Weeks Notice publicity campaign in the spring of 2003, emerging cheerfully from Victoria Station (was I whistling?) and stopping dead in my tracks with my fingers in my mouth. Where was the apostrophe? Surely there should be an apostrophe on that bus? If it were &#x201c;one month&#x2019;s notice&#x201d; there would be an apostrophe (I reasoned); yes, and if it were &#x201c;one week&#x2019;s notice&#x201d; there would be an apostrophe. Therefore &#x201c;two weeks&#x2019; notice&#x201d; requires an apostrophe! Buses that I should have caught (the 73; two 38s) sailed off up Buckingham Palace Road while I communed thus at length with my inner stickler, unable to move or, indeed, regain any sense of perspective.<br><br>Part of one&#x2019;s despair, of course, is that the world cares nothing for the little shocks endured by the sensitive stickler. While we look in horror at a badly punctuated sign, the world carries on around us, blind to our plight. We are like the little boy in The Sixth Sense who can see dead people, except that we can see dead punctuation. Whisper it in petrified little-boy tones: dead punctuation is invisible to everyone else &#x2013; yet we see it all the time. No one understands us seventh-sense people. They regard us as freaks. When we point out illiterate mistakes we are often aggressively instructed to &#x201c;get a life&#x201d; by people who, interestingly, display no evidence of having lives themselves. Naturally we become timid about making our insights known, in such inhospitable conditions. Being burned as a witch is not safely enough off the agenda. A sign has gone up in a local charity-shop window which says, baldly, &#x201c;Can you spare any old records&#x201d; (no question mark) and I dither daily outside on the pavement. Should I go in and mention it? It does matter that there&#x2019;s no question mark on a direct question. It is appalling ignorance. But what will I do if the elderly charity-shop lady gives me the usual disbelieving stare and then tells me to bugger off, get a life and mind my own business?<br><br>On the other hand, I&#x2019;m well aware there is little profit in asking for sympathy for sticklers. We are not the easiest people to feel sorry for. We refuse to patronise any shop with checkouts for &#x201c;eight items or less&#x201d; (because it should be &#x201c;fewer&#x201d;), and we got very worked up after 9/11 not because of Osama bin-Laden but because people on the radio kept saying &#x201c;enormity&#x201d; when they meant &#x201c;magnitude&#x201d;, and we really hate that. When we hear the construction &#x201c;Mr Blair was stood&#x201d; (instead of &#x201c;standing&#x201d;) we suck our teeth with annoyance, and when words such as &#x201c;phenomena&#x201d;, &#x201c;media&#x201d; or &#x201c;cherubim&#x201d; are treated as singular (&#x201c;The media says it was quite a phenomena looking at those cherubims&#x201d;), some of us cannot suppress actual screams. Sticklers never read a book without a pencil at hand, to correct the typographical errors. In short, we are unattractive know-all obsessives who get things out of proportion and are in continual peril of being disowned by our exasperated families.<br><br>I know precisely when my own damned stickler personality started to get the better of me. In the autumn of 2002, I was making a series of programmes about punctuation for Radio 4 called Cutting a Dash. My producer invited John Richards of the Apostrophe Protection Society to come and talk to us. At that time, I was quite tickled by the idea of an Apostrophe Protection Society, on whose website could be found photographic examples of ungrammatical signs such as &#x201c;The judges decision is final&#x201d; and &#x201c;No dog&#x2019;s&#x201d;. We took Mr Richards on a trip down Berwick Street Market to record his reaction to some greengrocers&#x2019; punctuation (&#x201c;Potatoe&#x2019;s&#x201d; and so on), and then sat down for a chat about how exactly one goes about protecting a conventional printer&#x2019;s mark that, through no fault of its own, seems to be terminally flailing in a welter of confusion.<br><br>What the APS does is write courteous letters, he said. A typical letter would explain the correct use of the apostrophe, and express the gentle wish that, should the offending &#x201c;BOB,S PETS&#x201d; sign (with a comma) be replaced one day, this well-meant guidance might be borne in mind. It was at this point that I felt a profound and unignorable stirring. It was the awakening of my Inner Stickler. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not enough!&#x201d; I said. Suddenly I was a-buzz with ideas. What about issuing stickers printed with the words &#x201c;This apostrophe is not necessary&#x201d;? What about telling people to shin up ladders at dead of night with an apostrophe-shaped stencil and a tin of paint? Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?<br><br>,<br><br>Punctuation has been defined many ways. Some grammarians use the analogy of stitching: punctuation as the basting that holds the fabric of language in shape. Another writer tells us that punctuation marks are the traffic signals of language: they tell us to slow down, notice this, take a detour, and stop. I have even seen a rather fanciful reference to the full stop and comma as &#x201c;the invisible servants in fairy tales &#x2013; the ones who bring glasses of water and pillows, not storms of weather or love&#x201d;. But best of all, I think, is the simple advice given by the style book of a national newspaper: that punctuation is &#x201c;a courtesy designed to help readers to understand a story without stumbling&#x201d;.<br><br>Isn&#x2019;t the analogy with good manners perfect? Truly good manners are invisible: they ease the way for others, without drawing attention to themselves. It is no accident that the word &#x201c;punctilious&#x201d; (&#x201c;attentive to formality or etiquette&#x201d;) comes from the same original root word as punctuation. As we shall see, the practice of &#x201c;pointing&#x201d; our writing has always been offered in a spirit of helpfulness, to underline meaning and prevent awkward misunderstandings between writer and reader. In 1644 a schoolmaster from Southwark, Richard Hodges, wrote in his The English Primrose that &#x201c;great care ought to be had in writing, for the due observing of points: for, the neglect thereof will pervert the sense&#x201d;, and he quoted as an example, &#x201c;My Son, if sinners intise [entice] thee consent thou, not refraining thy foot from their way.&#x201d; Imagine the difference to the sense, he says, if you place the comma after the word &#x201c;not&#x201d;: &#x201c;My Son, if sinners intise thee consent thou not, refraining thy foot from their way.&#x201d; This was the 1644 equivalent of Ronnie Barker in Porridge, reading the sign-off from a fellow lag&#x2019;s letter from home, &#x201c;Now I must go and get on my lover&#x201d;, and then pretending to notice a comma, so hastily changing it to, &#x201c;Now I must go and get on, my lover.&#x201d;<br><br>To be fair, many people who couldn&#x2019;t punctuate their way out of a paper bag are still interested in the way punctuation can alter the sense of a string of words. It is the basis of all &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;ll read that again&#x201d; jokes. Instead of &#x201c;What would you with the king?&#x201d; you can have someone say in Marlowe&#x2019;s Edward II, &#x201c;What? Would you? With the king?&#x201d; The consequences of mispunctuation (and re-punctuation) have appealed to both great and little minds, and in the age of the fancy-that email a popular example is the comparison of two sentences:<br><br>A woman, without her man, is nothing. A woman: without her, man is nothing.<br><br>Which, I don&#x2019;t know, really makes you think, doesn&#x2019;t it? Here is a popular &#x201c;Dear Jack&#x201d; letter that works in much the same fundamentally pointless way: Dear Jack,<br><br>I want a man who knows what love is all about. You are generous, kind, thoughtful. People who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me for other men. I yearn for you. I have no feelings whatsoever when we&#x2019;re apart. I can be forever happy &#x2013; will you let me be yours?<br><br>Jill Dear Jack,<br><br>I want a man who knows what love is. All about you are generous, kind, thoughtful people, who are not like you. Admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me. For other men I yearn! For you I have no feelings whatsoever. When we&#x2019;re apart I can be forever happy. Will you let me be?<br><br>Yours,<br><br>Jill But just to show there is nothing very original about all this, five hundred years before email a similarly tiresome puzzle was going round:<br><br>Every Lady in this Land Hath 20 Nails on each Hand; Five &amp; twenty on Hands and Feet; And this is true, without deceit.<br><br>(Every lady in this land has twenty nails. On each hand, five; and twenty on hands and feet.)<br><br>So all this is quite amusing, but it is noticeable that no one emails the far more interesting example of the fateful mispunctuated telegram that precipitated the Jameson Raid on the Transvaal in 1896 &#x2013; I suppose that&#x2019;s a reflection of modern education for you. Do you know of the Jameson Raid, described as a &#x201c;fiasco&#x201d;? Marvellous punctuation story. Throw another log on that fire. The Transvaal was a Boer republic at the time, and it was believed that the British and other settlers around Johannesburg (who were denied civil rights) would rise up if Jameson invaded. But unfortunately, when the settlers sent their telegraphic invitation to Jameson, it included a tragic ambiguity:<br><br>It is under these circumstances that we feel constrained to call upon you to come to our aid should a disturbance arise here the circumstances are so extreme that we cannot but believe that you and the men under you will not fail to come to the rescue of people who are so situated.<br><br>As Eric Partridge points out in his Usage and Abusage, if you place a full stop after the word &#x201c;aid&#x201d; in this passage, the message is unequivocal. It says, &#x201c;Come at once!&#x201d; If you put it after &#x201c;here&#x201d;, however, it says something more like, &#x201c;We might need you at some later date depending on what happens here, but in the meantime &#x2013; don&#x2019;t call us, Jameson, old boy; we&#x2019;ll call you.&#x201d; Of course, the message turned up at The Times with a full stop after &#x201c;aid&#x201d; (no one knows who put it there) and poor old Jameson just sprang to the saddle, without anybody wanting or expecting him to.<br><br>All of which substantiates Partridge&#x2019;s own metaphor for punctuation, which is that it&#x2019;s &#x201c;the line along which the train (composition, style, writing) must travel if it isn&#x2019;t to run away with its driver&#x201d;. In other words, punctuation keeps sense on the rails. Of course people will always argue over levels of punctuation, accusing texts of having too much or too little. There is an enjoyable episode in Peter Hall&#x2019;s Diaries when, in advance of directing Albert Finney in Hamlet, he &#x201c;fillets&#x201d; the text of &#x201c;practically all its punctuation except what is essential to sense&#x201d; and then finds he has to live with the consequences. On August 21, 1975, he notes, &#x201c;Shakespeare&#x2019;s text is always absurdly over-punctuated; generations of scholars have tried to turn him into a good grammarian.&#x201d; All of which sounds sensible enough, until we find the entry for the first rehearsal on September 22, which he describes as &#x201c;good&#x201d; but also admits was &#x201c;a rough and ready, stumbling reading, with people falling over words or misplaced emphases&#x201d;.<br><br>,<br><br>What happened to punctuation? Why is it so disregarded when it is self-evidently so useful in preventing enormous mix-ups? A headline in today&#x2019;s paper says, &#x201c;DEAD SONS PHOTOS MAY BE RELEASED&#x201d; &#x2013; the story relating to dead sons in the plural, but you would never know. The obvious culprit is the recent history of education practice. We can blame the pedagogues. Until 1960, punctuation was routinely taught in British schools. A child sitting a County Schools exam in 1937 would be asked to punctuate the following puzzler: &#x201c;Charles the First walked and talked half an hour after his head was cut off&#x201d; (answer: &#x201c;Charles the First walked and talked. Half an hour after, his head was cut off&#x201d;). Today, thank goodness, the National Curriculum ensures that when children are eight, they are drilled in the use of the comma, even if their understanding of grammar is at such an early age a bit hazy. For Cutting a Dash we visited a school in Cheshire where quite small children were being taught that you use commas in the following situations:<br><br>1 in a list<br><br>2 before dialogue<br><br>3 to mark out additional information<br><br>Which was very impressive. Identifying &#x201c;additional information&#x201d; at the age of eight is quite an achievement, and I know for a fact that I couldn&#x2019;t have done it. But if things are looking faintly more optimistic under the National Curriculum, there remains the awful truth that, for over a quarter of a century, punctuation and English grammar were simply not taught in the majority of schools, with the effect that A-level examiners annually bewailed the condition of examinees&#x2019; written English, while nothing was done. Candidates couldn&#x2019;t even spell the words &#x201c;grammar&#x201d; and &#x201c;sentence&#x201d;, let alone use them in any well-informed way.<br><br>Attending a grammar school myself between 1966 and 1973, I don&#x2019;t remember being taught punctuation, either. There was a comical moment in the fifth year when our English teacher demanded, &#x201c;But you have had lessons in grammar?&#x201d; and we all looked shifty, as if the fault was ours. We had been taught Latin, French and German grammar; but English grammar was something we felt we were expected to infer from our reading &#x2013; which is doubtless wh...</p><h2>Silver Angel</h2><p><p>Abducted and sold into slavery, Chantelle Burke has been brought to the palace of the mighty Pasha.

As he started out in politics he wrote editorials and letters to argue his case. He spoke to the public directly through the press. He even bought a German-language newspaper to appeal to that growing electorate in his state. Lincoln alternately pampered, battled, and manipulated the three most powerful publishers of the day: Horace Greeley of the <i>New York</i> <i>Tribune</i>, James Gordon Bennett of the <i>New York</i> <i>Herald</i>, and Henry Raymond of the <i>New York</i> <i>Times</i>.<br> <br>When war broke out and the nation was tearing itself apart, Lincoln authorized the most widespread censorship in the nation&#x2019;s history, closing down papers that were &#x201c;disloyal&#x201d; and even jailing or exiling editors who opposed enlistment or sympathized with secession.

Such was never more the case than in 1859&#x2014;the eve of the most potentially divisive presidential election in American history.<br> <br>As a state capital boasting some nine thousand permanent residents&#x2014;and far greater than that number whenever politicians and lobbyists jammed into town for annual legislative sessions&#x2014;Springfield served as a year-round stage for partisan speeches, rallies, parades, picnics, barbecues, illuminations, conventions, and outright street brawls over both issues and candidates. Even with its population in perpetual flux owing to the almost daily arrival and departure of new residents, its voting-age men stood equally (some said hopelessly) divided between Democrats and Republicans. Whether the legislature was in or out of session, Springfield&#x2019;s citizens remained passionate about their politics year-round, ever ready to argue the issues of the day, both in person and in print.2<br> <br>Fueling this combustible mix were Springfield&#x2019;s two major newspapers. Both covered neighborhood news with anodyne charm, but when it came to local, state, and national politics, both stoked the ferment with an overtly partisan style that combined advocacy with almost libelous criticism. One paper was dependably pro-Democratic, the other unfailingly pro-Republican, and each was steadfastly, often maliciously, opposed to the other. Rather than merely reprint what one editor termed the city&#x2019;s constant &#x201c;flood of eloquence&#x201d;3 from politicians on both sides, these irreconcilable journals could be depended on to laud allies and eviscerate opponents. When they were not dishing out equal doses of praise and rage in their regular editions, they engaged their presses to print party pamphlets and political orations. If they were fortunate and well connected, they received rewards for their loyalty in the form of government printing jobs. The mutual interdependence that grew up between the press and politics made for a toxic brew. No politician was above it, no editor beyond it, and no reader immune to it.<br> <br>Now, with the next national election only a year away, with the contest already being widely touted as the most crucial of the century, and with the issue of slavery roiling the country, local interest in national issues and personalities approached a fever pitch in Springfield, in part for a reason unique to this otherwise typically divided Western city. For by 1859, its residents could boast that their town had incubated two immensely gifted potential aspirants for the White House: United States senator Stephen A. Douglas, and former congressman Abraham Lincoln.<br> <br>Douglas, the &#x201c;Little Giant,&#x201d; led the pack among his fellow Democrats. And while &#x201c;Long Abraham&#x201d; was perhaps not yet widely known enough nationally to rank as a top-tier contender for the Republicans, he remained an intriguing dark-horse possibility for their ticket&#x2014;perhaps, as some ardent supporters began whispering, for vice president. No one knows precisely when Lincoln began aiming still higher, but to bring the presidency within his sights he certainly knew where he needed first to burnish his political profile: in the Republican Party press, and not just among the usual loyalists who read the newspapers in his hometown. Lincoln had been assiduously courting editors in nearby villages and cities for years. Describing his ambition as &#x201c;a little engine that knew no rest,&#x201d; his law partner and political confidant, William H. Herndon, testified that Lincoln &#x201c;never overlooked a newspaper man who had it in his power to say a good or bad thing of him.&#x201d;4 For now, however, Lincoln still lacked both real political power and routine attention in the press beyond Springfield. And he still thirsted for both.<br> <br>That May, Lincoln made a remarkable move to recalibrate this frustrating political equilibrium. The lifelong and voracious newspaper reader decided to become a newspaper owner as well&#x2014;by acquiring a weekly journal complete with its own printing press and a politically compatible editor ready to churn out enthusiastic editorials lauding him. It did not seem to matter that he would never be able to read the product himself. For the paper would be printed in German, a language he had only briefly studied but never mastered. Moreover, it would be composed in Gothic-style Fraktur typeface, an elaborate black-letter script no more decipherable to him than Sanskrit.5<br> <br>To comprehend what motivated this indelibly American politician to purchase a foreign language newspaper he could never hope to comprehend requires a quantum leap of historical imagination&#x2014;back to an era when the press and politics were profoundly interconnected, and newspapers themselves became more overtly partisan, more narrowly targeted, yet more deeply influential than at any time before or since.<br> <br>Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s emergence as a newspaper publisher constituted but one example of the pervasive and sometimes incestuous relationships that grew up between politicians and journalists in the fierce battles for public opinion and government power in the decades leading up to the Civil War&#x2014;and beyond. That such affiliations, however common at the time, were still considered vaguely unsavory by some, seems evident in how assiduously Lincoln kept his own newspaper investment quiet. Except for his private banker, his law partner, and but one fellow Illinois Republican politician, he seems to have told no one about the purchase at the time, or, indeed, for the rest of his life. For four score years, his involvement remained largely unknown even to biographers.6 Yet the truth is, the arrangement would likely have surprised, much less scandalized, few of his contemporaries.<br> <br>Lincoln was neither the first nor the last politician of his era to dabble in the newspaper business&#x2014;ethnic or otherwise, covertly or not. Countless prominent officials of the mid-nineteenth century did so with confident abandon, making partisan journalism an integral cog in their political machines. This vanished tradition informs the neglected story explored in this book: how in the age of Lincoln the press and politics often functioned in tandem as a single, tightly organized entity in the furious competition to win power and to promote&#x2014;or, alternatively, resist&#x2014;political and social change. The financial and popular success that many newspapers enjoyed in pursuit of political goals enabled them to influence both leaders and events, and emboldened them to report on politics with a biased fury unimaginable in previous or subsequent generations. Not until the Civil War would precedent-shattering conflicts arise between government and the press, forcing these traditions into dramatic (and perhaps overdue) change.<br> <br>To explore these complex relationships, and calculate their profound impact on history, this book proposes to reexamine Lincoln&#x2019;s political life through prominent period newspapers and their editors&#x2014;focusing not just on how newspapers reported on and influenced his ascent, but how his own struggle for power, and that of most of his political contemporaries, unfolded within a concurrent competition for preeminence among newspapermen to influence politics and politicians. Newspapers of the day occasionally manufactured politicians, just as politicians often manufactured newspapers&#x2014;but in the end they were of, by, and for the same environment. They became mutually dependent and totally inseparable&#x2014;weapons in the same arsenal. In some cases, they synchronized their efforts so closely that it was impossible to determine where one organization ended its work and the other began it. Lincoln embraced and thrived in this milieu, yet the story has escaped full scrutiny since.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The emergence of a party press had begun in earnest the century before. In the mid-1790s, the explosive growth of political enthusiasm and the slow but sure development of improved printing technologies coincided to make newspapers more widely available as well as more openly partisan, and served to connect politicians to both editors and their subscribers. In time, readers came to align themselves with party newspapers as routinely as they began aligning themselves with political organizations: both loyalties helped define their identities. In this atmosphere, political parties commenced openly funding and promoting sympathetic newspapers, while newspapers began overtly shilling for party organizations. Newspapers not only brought people together, Alexis de Tocqueville observed, but remained &#x201c;necessary to keep them together&#x201d;&#x2014;and, as it often turned out in a vast and increasingly sectionalized nation, to keep them apart.7<br> <br>George Washington&#x2019;s second administration was the first to endure this seismic shift in the relationship between politics and publishing. An increasingly robust anti-Washington press surprised and dismayed the father of his country, who was accustomed to universal approbation, and its growth may have helped dissuade him from seeking a third term. The long, subsequent conflict between John Adams&#x2019;s Federalists and Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Democratic-Republicans further hardened newspaper loyalties, inspiring press attacks on political leaders that occasionally bordered on the scurrilous. Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s grandson, Benjamin Bache, founded the American Aurora specifically to advance the Jeffersonian worldview and eviscerate Adams&#x2019;s affection for the British.8 Adams infamously reacted by signing a sedition law that imposed fines and imprisonment on editors who dared to &#x201c;print, utter or publish . . . scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States.&#x201d; No less convinced that newspapers presented &#x201c;only the caricatures of disaffected minds,&#x201d; Jefferson variously courted and suppressed the press, too. Late in life, he claimed that he read only the Richmond Enquirer, &#x201c;and in that chiefly the advertisements,&#x201d; as he caustically remarked, &#x201c;for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper.&#x201d;9<br> <br>Yet there was no ignoring the press&#x2019;s growing ubiquity and influence. New York state alone boasted thirty-one hand-printed newspapers by the beginning of the new century.10 Within ten years, the country at large could count 376 papers selling more than 22 million copies annually&#x2014;even though fully half the American population was then sixteen years old or younger, a fifth were slaves barred from reading altogether, and most literate subscribers commonly shared their papers with as many as twenty friends and relatives each. As Noah Webster marveled: &#x201c;In no other country on earth, not even in Great Britain, are Newspapers so generally circulated among the body of the people, as in America.&#x201d;11<br> <br>To speed government news to this scattered population, leading politicians and journalists hatched the transformational idea in around 1800 of designating one particular Washington-based newspaper as an official political &#x201c;organ.&#x201d; For generations thereafter, whenever one party or another took over the White House, an anointed journal assumed the privilege of breaking administration news in the capital, and introducing debate points that papers in outlying cities could readily adopt for their own readers.<br> <br>By this time, only the absence of faster printing presses and more reliable transportation systems stood in the way of spreading political information more rapidly throughout the news-hungry young nation. Even editors privy to exclusive stories could not yet rush them to readers dwelling in isolated rural outposts. Communications remained so sluggish that press reports of the European peace treaty ending the War of 1812 failed to reach either General Andrew Jackson or his British foes at New Orleans in time to prevent them from fighting a fierce battle there. Jackson proceeded to lead his troops to a victory that won him glory&#x2014;and perhaps the presidency&#x2014;but in retrospect proved unnecessary. As an occupier, he promptly limited freedom of the press in the city, in one case arresting a citizen for publishing a critical letter to the editor (a case Lincoln would later cite in defending his own wartime restrictions on freedom of the press). Jackson firmly held that newspapers often villainously misled the public &#x201c;through ignorance but more frequently from dishonest design.&#x201d;12<br> <br>&#x201c;Old Hickory&#x201d; apparently learned from such experiences. For one thing, he named Amos Kendall, editor of the pro-Democratic Argus of Western America, as postmaster general.13 Expanding on the tradition of rewarding loyal newspapers once he became president, he saw to the creation of an entirely new, official administration organ called the United States Telegraph. Its editor, a Missouri-born former Indian fighter named Duff Green, who remained professionally active into the Civil War era, composed his editorial &#x201c;batteries&#x201d; with &#x201c;such vigor and clamor&#x201d; that he quickly earned the nickname &#x201c;Rough Green.&#x201d;14 Green innovatively used his position as the president&#x2019;s official journalist to establish a large personal following and a wide network of pro-Jackson publications nationwide&#x2014;essentially the first newspaper &#x201c;chain,&#x201d; one in this case linked by shared political beliefs.<br> <br>To broaden circulation of the Telegraph, Green initiated a more dubious tradition by seeing to it that Democratic congressmen assumed the cost of distributing his paper in their home districts, a practice that not surprisingly invited abuse. One representative was soon discovered to be using his free postal privileges to send more than sixteen hundred papers to constituents in Kentucky.15 Unthinkable today, such crossover relationships became commonplace in the early nineteenth century, when newspapers were expected to...</p><h2>The Jeremiah Study Bible, NKJV: (Charcoal w/ burnished edges) LeatherLuxe� w/thumb index: What It Says.

We shall say only that <i>The Return of the Soldier</i> concerns the title character and three very different women to whom he is linked in very different ways--by blood, by marriage, and by love. It is also an imaginative study (one drenched in realism) of intimacy and illusion, possession and a terrible, destructive snobbery. On one estate outside London, even as the Great War and familial loss are taking their toll, the inhabitants strive for a measured, outwardly exquisite existence. All must remain as it was while their Chris is at war: each person, each object in its proper place. "You probably know the beauty of that view," the narrator buttonholes us, looking out the nursery window: <blockquote> For when Chris rebuilt Baldry Court after his marriage, he handed it over to architects who had not so much the wild eye of the artist as the knowing wink of the manicurist, and between them they massaged the dear old place into matter for innumerable photos in the illustrated papers. </blockquote> But of late this universe unto itself cannot quite keep out an England altered by ambition and industry. Only a few miles away a "red suburban stain," Wealdstone, has somehow cropped up. And one day all is permanently altered--or, rather, revealed--when a Wealdstone resident comes bearing news of Captain Baldry. Mrs. William Gray is clearly not of Chris's wife Kitty and his cousin Jenny's class, as Kitty in particular makes her aware. "Again her gray eyes brimmed," Jenny observes. "People are rude to one, she visibly said, but surely not nice people like this." How is it, then, that this dreary, "dingy" woman knows Chris and knows that something has happened to him? And how is it that Jenny soon comes to see her as someone "whose personality was sounding through her squalor like a beautiful voice singing in a darkened room"?<p> In the remainder of this brief, perfect novel, a vanished (or repressed) past and its lost prospect of happiness comes to the fore. Rebecca West is best remembered for <i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia</i> (1941), but she displays the same vision--and a similar degree of realism--in her charged 1916 novel. Many readers will passionately regret the book's last twist, even as they know it to be artistically as well as historically true. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Set during World War I on an isolated country estate just outside London, Rebecca West's haunting novel The Return of the Soldier follows Chris Baldry, a shell-shocked captain suffering from amnesia, as he makes a bittersweet homecoming to the three women who have helped shape his life. Will the devoted wife he can no longer recollect, the favorite cousin he remembers only as a childhood friend, and the poor innkeeper's daughter he once courted leave Chris to languish in a safe, dreamy past--or will they help him recover his memory so that he can return to the front? The answer is revealed through a heartwrenching, unexpected sacrifice.<br>The text of this Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the first American edition, published in 1918, and features original illustrations by Norman Price.</p><h2>Merrie (Sunfire, #25)</h2><p>When Merrie Courtland stows away on the Mayflower, she finds herself torn between her attraction to both the sailor Luke Bosworth and Zachariah Gaines, a doctor&#39;s assistant.</p><p>Merrie, a feisty heroine during the time of the Mayflower landing at Plymouth, has two handsome boys to choose from.

JULES FEIFFER has won a number of prizes for his cartoons, plays, and screenplays, including the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning. His books for children include The House Across the Street; By the Side of the Road; I&#39;m Not Bobby; I Lost My Bear; and Meanwhile..He lives in New York City.</p><p>PreS&#x2013;Beginning at his toes, a little girl laboriously climbs up her father until she is perched triumphantly on top of his head. Along the way, she provides practical advice on making this a successful procedure: "Remember, the Daddy Mountain must wear a shirt. Because if you grab hold of his skin, he'll get mad." Although Feiffer keeps a reasonable amount of suspense going during this combination ordeal/adventure, there is little substance to inspire rereading and little appeal for youngsters who have outgrown attempting this feat. What story there is descends into stereotypes: when the child reaches her goal (as shown on a two-page vertical foldout), her father nonchalantly declares, "No problem, she's fine," and seems proud of his daughter's accomplishment, while her mother's reaction is to faint. The illustrations are vintage Feiffer; for most of the book, Daddy's body is drawn&#x2013;mountain still&#x2013;in charcoal, while the girl is depicted with much more fluid black lines and bright colors. While the pictures capture the full range of her emotions, they do not elevate the title to anything other than an additional purchase.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"I have to be brave," says a little girl at the (literal) foot of the Daddy Mountain, seen as a series of decontextualized body segments sketched in charcoal greys. She shinnies upward from loafers to shins and beyond, a vintage-Feiffer bundle of windmilling arms, jutting knees and elbows, and mutable facial expressions. Step-by-step commentary ("Now this is the tricky part . . . ") accompanies her ascent, which concludes with a vertical foldout revealing Dad transformed from faceless "landform" to a grinning accomplice, his daughter perched atop his head. Given the choice between this and Feiffer's <i>Bark, George </i>(1999)<i>,</i> children may reach for the latter for its brighter colors and greater variety of characters. In the end, this may resonate more with grown-ups, who will nod in recognition of daddies' special fondness for roughhousing--and laugh at the last-page depiction of an apoplectic mom: "I think she's going to faint." <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

That judgment, implausible even to a casual fan, also contradicted the opinion of a growing cadre of neuroscientists who worked in vain to convince the NFL that it was facing a deadly new scourge: A chronic brain disease that was driving an alarming number of players -- including some of the all-time greats -- to madness.<br><i>League of Denial</i> reveals how the NFL, over a period of nearly two decades, sought to cover up and deny mounting evidence of the connection between football and brain damage.<br>Comprehensively, and for the first time, award-winning ESPN investigative reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru tell the story of a public health crisis that emerged from the playing fields of our 21st century pastime. Everyone knew that football is violent and dangerous. But what the players who built the NFL into a $10 billion industry didn&#x2019;t know &#x2013; and what the league sought to shield from them &#x2013; is that no amount of padding could protect the human brain from the force generated by modern football; that the very essence of the game could be exposing these players to brain damage.<br>In a fast-paced narrative that moves between the NFL trenches, America&#x2019;s research labs and the boardrooms where the NFL went to war against science, <i>League of Denial</i> examines how the league used its power and resources to attack independent scientists and elevate its own flawed research -- a campaign with echoes of Big Tobacco&#x2019;s fight to deny the connection between smoking and lung cancer. It chronicles the tragic fates of players like Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster, who was so disturbed at the time of his death he fantasized about shooting NFL executives; and former Chargers great Junior Seau, whose diseased brain became the target of an unseemly scientific battle between researchers and the NFL. Based on exclusive interviews, previously undisclosed documents and private emails, this is the story of what the NFL knew and when it knew it &#x2013; questions at the heart of crisis that threatens football, from the highest levels all the way down to Pop Warner.</p><p><b>Mark Fainaru-Wada</b> is an investigative reporter for ESPN.

I took a seat at a table in the back. The pile <br> of red hair at the front shook itself like a dog shaking off the weather. A hand beckoned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Won&#x2019;t do, Mr. Joyce.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sighed, grabbed my backpack, and found a place up front. The pile of hair parted itself, revealing a considerable length of nose and eyes of violent blue.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My name is Judy Zombrowski. You can call me Z. Do you know Ms. Gold?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The hand directed my attention to a woman sitting directly to my left. She had a perfectly square chin, high cheekbones, and long, brown hair that turned crimson in the late--afternoon sun. Sarah Gold waved. I felt queasy. Gloriously so.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We know each other from undergrad,&#x201d; Sarah said, smiling at me as if we&#x2019;d exchanged more than three words during our four years together.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course you do.&#x201d; Z cast a look toward the back of the room. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re waiting for one more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A door banged open.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third student in the summer graduate seminar was tall and angular. He had thick shoulders and a long jaw covered by a blond scruff of beard. His eyes were shaded and hard to read.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jake Havens?&#x201d; Z&#x2019;s voice rang down the empty aisle and echoed off the walls. Havens took the same seat I&#x2019;d picked out for myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is it with you people?&#x201d; Z waved Havens forward. &#x201c;Up here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good, thanks.&#x201d; His voice was ragged, like a car knocking through its low end of gears. He looked older. In his thirties, even.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine. Sit where you want.&#x201d; Z poked at the mass of papers piled up around her. From underneath a legal pad she pulled out what looked like a Big Mac and unwrapped it. She took a bite, then found a Coke with a straw and sipped.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, can someone tell me what we&#x2019;re here for?&#x201d; Z took another bite and watched us as she chewed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to work on wrongful convictions.&#x201d; Sarah Gold tapped a pen lightly against the table as she spoke. &#x201c;Men who&#x2019;ve been sentenced to death for crimes they didn&#x2019;t commit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean murder, Ms. Gold.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Z.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Z.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what if, heaven forbid, the son of a bitch is guilty?&#x201d; A pickle dropped out of Z&#x2019;s Big Mac. She ignored it. &#x201c;What if you spend the quarter working a file and, at the end of the day, he raped the little girl, cut her into pieces, and stuffed them all into Hefty bags. Just like the state said he did.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah opened her mouth to speak.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not finished,&#x201d; Z said. &#x201c;What if you work a case and are convinced the poor bastard is innocent? Not a doubt about it. But you don&#x2019;t have the evidence. Or you do have the evidence, but for some reason it&#x2019;s tainted. Inadmissible. What then?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z took another bite of her sandwich, put it down, and held up her hands like she was a doctor getting ready to operate. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not supposed to eat this stuff, but I love it.&#x201d; She wiped her fingers with a napkin, wrapped up what was left of the burger, and stuffed it into its paper bag. &#x201c;My point is this. We have a lot of files. And a lot of possible outcomes. But we don&#x2019;t root for one result over the other.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do we root for?&#x201d; Sarah said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The truth, if we can find it. And a good story. As for the actual workings of our legal system&#x201d;&#x2014;-a flick of hands to the heavens&#x2014;-&#x201c;sometimes it&#x2019;s necessary to let things fall where they may. Do you understand what I&#x2019;m getting at?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We all nodded.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Like hell you do. But that&#x2019;s all right. Just keep in mind rule number one. The evidence is what it is. Allow it to tell its own story. Don&#x2019;t shape it to support a certain outcome. We&#x2019;ll talk more about all of this later. For now, why don&#x2019;t we get started?&#x201d; Z gestured to the stack of brown files climbing the wall behind her. &#x201c;These are just a few cases you can look at. We have another roomful down the hall.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do we start anywhere in particular?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Or just dig in?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This seminar is all about instinct, Mr. Joyce. And who has it. In fact, our very first case relied on little more than a hunch. Have any of you heard this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We all shook our heads. Z seemed pleased.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Our first case involved a man named Charles Granger. He was convicted of shooting a man dead over a drug deal and sentenced to die by the state of Indiana. In the spring of 1999, we read through the file in this very classroom. None of us bought it. No one was sure why, <br> but the facts just didn&#x2019;t hang together. So we ordered up Granger&#x2019;s trial transcripts and began to work the case. We eventually zeroed in on the state&#x2019;s eyewitness. At first, she was scared to talk to us. We sent her some letters from Granger. Then we sent her a calendar with Granger&#x2019;s scheduled execution date circled. She wound up recanting her testimony, and the whole thing came apart. Charles Granger spent fifteen years on death row. At one point, he was forty--eight hours from being killed. And we saved his life. This seminar has saved eight other lives since then. And gotten at least that many released from decades of prison time for crimes they didn&#x2019;t commit. This will be the best work you&#x2019;ll ever do. It will also be the most demanding. And a lot of it will depend on you trusting your gut.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z rattled the ice in her Coke and sucked on the straw until she hit bottom. Then she threw the cup in the vicinity of a barrel. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been chosen for this seminar because you&#x2019;re the best. At least that&#x2019;s what they tell me. I&#x2019;ve won three Pulitzer Prizes in my career, so I know talent. And from where I sit, the screening committee for this course gets it right a little more than half the time. Which means at least one of you doesn&#x2019;t belong. But we&#x2019;ll see. Now, I&#x2019;d like to head down the hall for a walk--through of our filing system.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z stood. Sarah and I got up with her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already got a case.&#x201d; Jake Havens was still slouched in his chair, eyes fastened on the floor. &#x201c;Name&#x2019;s James Harrison. Fourteen years ago, he was convicted of killing a ten--year--old kid in Chicago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z smiled so I could see her eyeteeth. &#x201c;Mr. Havens. Nice of you to check in. We tend not to focus as much on cases in Illinois since the state abolished its death penalty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Havens looked up. &#x201c;What happened to &#x2018;trusting your instinct&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say we couldn&#x2019;t take a look at an Illinois case. Just that, all things being equal, it might not be a priority.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But all things aren&#x2019;t equal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not following you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;First of all, Harrison&#x2019;s dead. Fourteen months in prison and they found him stuck in the neck with a shank.&#x201d; Havens climbed to his feet and moved down the aisle until he stood on the other side of Sarah. He pulled a thick file from a tattered backpack and thunked it down in front of him. &#x201c;This is everything I could find. Mostly newspaper clippings. And the original police report.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z ignored the paperwork. &#x201c;Why would we look into a case where the convicted man is deceased?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does the fact that he&#x2019;s dead make him any less innocent?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z licked her lips. First day and the prof was pissed. Great.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mr. Havens, let&#x2019;s take this up after class&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Havens pulled a wrinkled gray envelope out of his pack and laid it beside the file.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have something else for us?&#x201d; Z&#x2019;s voice rose with her eyebrows.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a letter, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can see that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I received it four days ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In the mail?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no stamp,&#x201d; Sarah said, tilting her head to get a closer look.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was tucked under the front door of my apartment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When, Mr. Havens?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I told you. Four days ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z nodded. &#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I could feel the shift in the room. Z was no longer the teacher. And Jake Havens, no longer just a student.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I woke up and it was sitting in my hallway. So I opened it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who else has handled it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pretty sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what do you think is in there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know what&#x2019;s in there. It&#x2019;s a note from the killer. The real killer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z walked to the back of the classroom and closed the door. She returned with a box of latex gloves. We each took a pair and snapped them on. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the envelope. Z&#x2019;s cloak--and--dagger only made things better. She picked up the envelope and studied it. There was no address, just jake havens printed in block letters of black ink.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Was it sealed, Mr. Havens?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jake shook his head. Z didn&#x2019;t seem surprised. She opened the envelope and eased out its contents&#x2014;-a single sheet of paper filled with more block lettering. Z pressed the page flat on the table and we all read.<br> &nbsp;<br> 98--2425&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. i kilt the boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else.&#x201d; Havens reached into his pack again, this time pulling out a small piece of cloth. He placed it down beside the letter. My hand picked it up before the rest of me realized what I&#x2019;d done. It was a ragged cut. The fabric, white with a black stripe running through it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Looks like it&#x2019;s from a shirt,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was in with the note,&#x201d; Havens said. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s got blood on it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah had taken the piece of cloth from me. Now, she let it slip from her fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My guess,&#x201d; Havens continued, &#x201c;is that it was cut from the shirt the victim was wearing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How do you know what the victim was wearing?&#x201d; Z said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Havens placed a hand on the file. &#x201c;Case number 98--2425. The victim&#x2019;s name was Skylar Wingate. According to the cops, he was wearing a black--and--white cotton shirt. Seems to match what we&#x2019;ve got here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Z sighed like she&#x2019;d heard it all before. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re leaving out a few facts, Mr. Havens.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You remember the case?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a pretty big deal in its day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did he leave out?&#x201d; Sarah said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As I recall,&#x201d; Z said, &#x201c;they did DNA testing on blood found on the jeans James Harrison was wearing when he was arrested. Came back as a perfect match to the victim.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah and I turned our gaze back to Havens.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The DNA testing was done postconviction,&#x201d; Havens said. &#x201c;Harrison demanded and paid for it himself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What does that matter?&#x201d; Sarah said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why does a guy who&#x2019;s filing an appeal pay for DNA testing that&#x2019;s going to remove all doubt of his guilt?&#x201d; Havens said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Desperation,&#x201d; Z said. &#x201c;Do enough of these stories, and you&#x2019;ll learn all about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I picked up the piece of torn fabric. &#x201c;Would they still have the shirt in evidence?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If this guy was killed in prison,&#x201d; Sarah said, &#x201c;why would they keep anything?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We all turned again to Z, who seemed to think long and hard for a moment. She scribbled something on a legal pad and pushed it over to Havens. &#x201c;The Cook County Clerk&#x2019;s Office takes custody of trial transcripts and physical evidence once a case is closed. Transcripts and related trial documents are stored off--site, in a permanent records center. Actual physical evidence is kept in the county&#x2019;s warehouse.

I&#x2019;ll make a call this afternoon and e--mail you if I get an okay. Assuming I do, you guys go down there and see what you can dig up on the shirt. Show me something substantive next time we meet, something that gives us a way around the DNA match&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or we move on. Fair enough?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We looked at one another and nodded. Z tucked the torn piece of shirt into the gray envelope and pinched it between her fingers. &#x201c;Meanwhile, this stays with me. Now, does anyone else have anything they want to share? A Christmas card from John Wayne Gacy? Richard Speck&#x2019;s bra and panties? No? Good. If it&#x2019;s all right with Mr. Havens, I&#x2019;d appreciate ten minutes of your precious time to talk about the five hundred or so other cases we&#x2019;re working here at Medill.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Concept of Biblical Theology: An Old Testament Perspective</h2><p>A major overview and provocative analysis from a premier Old Testament scholar.</p><p>Biblical theology is contested territory: Is it legitimate to reflect theologically on such a diverse collection as the Bible, or even on one testament? Do theologians inevitably "christianize" the Hebrew bible? Does such an enterprise ride roughly over painstaking exegetical and historical work? And how can it relate to theological themes, such as creation and revelation, and to church life? <p>In this clearest and most comprehensive analysis of biblical theology to date, James Barr, an esteemed Oid Testament scholar and for thirty years a central figure in these debates, assesses the possibility, problems, and prospects of this oft-endangered discipline. He not only sketches the origins of modern biblical theology and its major types, he addresses fairly its relation to doctinal theology, religious studies, natural theology, and proclamation. Of special concern to Barr is how Jewish theologians use the bible and how well newer efforts, since 1970---especially story theology and canonical approaches---meet the test of an authentic and much-needed appropriation of the biblical text.</p>James Barr is Distinguished Professor of Hebrew Bible Emeritus at Vanderbilt Divinity School, Nashville, where he taught for ten years. His illustrious teaching career has also included professorships at Edinburgh University, Princeton Theological Seminary, Manchester University, and Oxford University. He has held visiting professorships and delivered major lecture series in Europe, the United States, Africa, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, and was longtime editor of the Journal of Semitic Studies.</p><h2>Victorious Christian Service: Studies in the Book of Nehemiah</h2><p>The events of Nehemiah&#39;s life may not be as familiar as the feats of David, the ark of Noah, or the storm tossing Jonah, but the hand of God is clearly upon this man&#39;s heart and mind.

He lives in Millbrook, Ontario, with his wife, their cat, two rabbits, five squirrels and a family of cardinals.Gr. 3-5. One in a series of Good Times Travel Agency cartoon-style peeks at ancient cultures, this humorously illustrated picture book takes kids on a brief trip to Greece at the time of the inception of the Olympic Games. The story line is cursory; it's the text at the bottom of each page that provides the important details about daily life, the role of women, how democracy worked in its founding society, the structure of Greek warships, and so on. The adventure aspect of the book is well pitched for the intended audience, but there is some needless editorializing, including the presumption that kids will find philosophy an inherently boring topic. Page layouts are effective, and the cartoon panels are handsomely painted, making this an inviting book to browse and a likely candidate for casual readers to consume willingly. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Trans fats are the absolute worst fats and should not be eaten at all. Recently, the U.S. National Academy of Science�s Institute of Medicine, the organization responsible for advising the U.S. government on health policy and responsible for determining the reference daily intake (RDI) for vitamins, concluded there is absolutely no safe level of intake for trans fat.2 Any food item listing �partially hydrogenated� or �hydrogenated oil� of any type, �margarine,� or �vegetable shortening� on its list of ingredients always contains at least some deadly trans fat. Also assume that all fried foods at restaurants and fast-food places contain trans fat. All of these products should be completely avoided.</p> <p>Trans fats are directly linked with heart disease. Alarmingly, trans fats are capable of altering your cholesterol profile toward the most dangerous ratio in terms of risk for heart disease and are even worse for you than saturated fat. Trans fats raise your bad LDL cholesterol level and your total cholesterol level while simultaneously lowering your good protective HDL cholesterol level.3 If all this isn�t bad enough, trans fats also increase your triglyceride level and impair artery dilation, a one-two punch that further increases your risk for heart artery disease.</p> <p>In a 1993 study in the prestigious medical journal Lancet, almost 90,000 healthy women were followed for eight years. There was a 50 percent increase in heart attacks and deaths in those women who ate just 5.7 grams per day of trans fats compared to women who ate only 2.4 grams per day of trans fat. Statistically, this difference was highly significant.4 The difference between 2.4 and 5.7 grams is less than one order of medium McDonald�s french fries or one standard-size glazed donut.</p> <p>According to evidence reported in 1999 by the Harvard University Department of Nutrition, up to 100,000 premature coronary deaths per year could be prevented by replacing partially hydrogenated oils with natural nonhydrogenated oils.5 Trans fats have also been linked to conditions other than heart disease. Trans fats block healthy fats from being converted into helpful inflammation fighters and cause your body to produce more inflammatory mediators,6 which increase blood clotting, increase blood pressure and worsen inflammationmediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis, Crohn�s disease, psoriasis and asthma.</p> <p>�2005.

With the gold and spices (and slaves) he would find, Columbus planned to fund a new Crusade to win back Jerusalem. At the time Columbus&#39;s voyage was insignificant, but it became one of the most important events in history. The colonisation he started was followed by the Dutch, French and British. Pioneers like Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci and the hundreds of Spaniards they inspired looked for riches, glory and to serve God in the New World. While they didn&#39;t believe the earth was flat, they thought an Earthly Paradise existed on the far side of the Indies, and that the rivers flowed with gold. Later the Conquistadores brought slavery, their irresistible weapons and European diseases to the ancient civilisations, and made Spain the richest nation in the world. &#39;A splendid volume, bold and strong in its outlines, rich in fascinating details, punctuated by well-chosen quotations from contemporaries and eyewitnesses, and accompanied by many maps and excellent illustrations&#39; Paul Johnson, Literary Review</p><p>Hugh Thomas has won the Somerset Maugham Prize and the National Book Award for History.

Filled with original author drawings and sketches, it&#x2019;s a must-have reference that will benefit designers of all levels.</p></p><p><p><b>Timothy Samara</b> is a graphic designer based in New York City, where he divides his time between teaching, writing, lecturing, and freelance consulting through STIM Visual Communication. His 18-year career in branding and information design has explored projects in print, packaging, environments, user interface design, and animation. He has been a senior art director at Ruder Finn, New York's largest public relations firm, and senior art director at Pettistudio, a small multidisciplinary design firm. Before relocating to Manhattan, he was principal of Physiologic in Syracuse, located in upstate New York. In 1990, he graduated a Trustee Scholar from the Graphic Design program at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia. Mr. Samara is a faculty member at New York's School of Visual Arts, New York University, Purchase College/SUNY, and The New School, and has published six books on design and typography, all through Rockport Publishers: <i>Making and Breaking the Grid</i>; <i>Typography Workbook</i>; <i>Publication Design Workbook</i>; <i>Type Style Finder</i>; <i>Design Elements</i>; and, most recently, <i>Design Evolution</i>, released in January 2008. Mr. Samara and his partner live in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p><b>Interval and Dynamism/ Symmetry and Asymmetry</b><br><br>Fighting the tendency of two-dimensional form to feel static&#x2014;in an awkward state of inertia&#x2014;is always challenging. A static visual condition usually results when positive and negative elements appear optically equal; when positive forms have similar mass or presence, when spatial intervals are of similar shape and size, and when these spaces also appear about the same size as the positive forms. Positive and negative need not be physically the same shape to appear equal in presence, so it is necessary to evaluate the aggregate mass of each, independent of their specific shapes.<br><br>The simplest strategies for ensuring dynamic composition, then, focus on enforcing differences in the variables of proportion and interval&#x2014;larger versus smaller; verticality versus horizontality; cluster and overlap versus tight proximity or generous spacing between elements; and linearity versus mass /A /.<br><br>Even when participating in an asymmetrical structure, multiple forms situated around similar spatial&nbsp; intervals create static interaction. Altering the intervals between form elements /E /, or between elements and format edges /F, G /, creates a dynamic composition. The movement of the eye is enhanced as these intervals exhibit greater contrast with each other, becoming compressed or expanding with a directional thrust. Symmetrical arrangements inherently confront the designer with a potentially static condition because the spatial intervals and shapes surrounding the material that is organized around the symmetrical axis are the same. To counteract this problem (in a bilaterally summetrical, vertical format, for instance), a designer may look to: exaggerate lateral width, spacing, and vertical emphasis changes /B/ as well as differences in vertical intervals; unexpectedly interrupt a repetition of intervals /C /; or violate the symmetry by shifting an element out of its mirrored relationship with corresponding elements across the axis /D/.<br></p><h2>The Ideology of Slavery: Proslavery Thought in the Antebellum South, 1830&#x2013;1860 (Library of Southern Civilization)</h2><p><p>In one volume, these essentially unabridged selections from the works of the proslavery apologists are now conveniently accessible to scholars and students of the antebellum South. The Ideology of Slavery includes excerpts by Thomas R. Dew, founder of a new phase of proslavery militancy; William Harper and James Henry Hammond, representatives of the proslavery mainstream; Thornton Stringfellow, the most prominent biblical defender of the peculiar institution; Henry Hughes and Josiah Nott, who brought would-be scientism to the argument; and George Fitzhugh, the most extreme of proslavery writers.<br>The works in this collection portray the development, mature essence, and ultimate fragmentation of the proslavery argument during the era of its greatest importance in the American South. Drew Faust provides a short introduction to each selection, giving information about the author and an account of the origin and publication of the document itself. <br>Faust's introduction to the anthology traces the early historical treatment of proslavery thought and examines the recent resurgence of interest in the ideology of the Old South as a crucial component of powerful relations within that society. She notes the intensification of the proslavery argument between 1830 and 1860, when southern proslavery thought became more systematic and self-conscious, taking on the characteristics of a formal ideology with its resulting social movement. From this intensification came the pragmatic tone and inductive mode that the editor sees as a characteristic of southern proslavery writings from the 1830s onward. The selections, introductory comments, and bibliography of secondary works on the proslavery argument will be of value to readers interested in the history of slavery and of nineteenth-centruy American thought.</p></p><p><p>Drew Gilpin Faust, associate professor and chairman of the department of American Civilization at the University of Pennsylvania, is the author of A Sacred Circle: The Dilemma of the Intellectual in the Old South, 1840-1860.</p></p><h2>Jane Austen - A Life</h2><p><p>At her death in 1817, Jane Austen left the world six of the most beloved novels written in English&#x2014;but her shortsighted family destroyed the bulk of her letters; and if she kept any diaries, they did not survive her.&nbsp; Now acclaimed biographer Claire Tomalin has filled the gaps in the record, creating a remarkably fresh and convincing portrait of the woman and the writer.&nbsp;<br><br>While most Austen biographers have accepted the assertion of Jane's brother Henry that "My dear Sister's life was not a life of events," Tomalin shows that, on the contrary, Austen's brief life was fraught with upheaval.&nbsp; Tomalin provides detailed and absorbing accounts of Austen's ill-fated love for a young Irishman, her frequent travels and extended visits to London, her close friendship with a worldly cousin whose French husband met his death on the guillotine, her brothers' naval service in the Napoleonic wars and in the colonies, and thus shatters the myth of Jane Austen as a sheltered and homebound spinster whose knowledge of the world was limited to the view from a Hampshire village.&nbsp;</p></p><p>The author of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Persuasion</i>, and other comedies of manners gets a biography similar in tone to her own books: intelligent but not intellectual, witty without being nasty. Claire Tomalin, author of four previous biographies of notable British women, treats Jane Austen (1775-1817) with the respect her genius deserves. Tomalin eschews gossip and speculation in favor of a sober account of the writer's life that nonetheless sparkles with sly humor. Perceptive analyses of each of Austen's novels, with autobiographical links suggested but never insisted upon, add to the value of <i>Jane Austen: A Life</i>.9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>BETRAYAL AT PEARL HARBOR: How Churchill Lured Roosevelt into World War II</h2><p>Examines events and Japanese naval code transmissions preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor to raise new questions concerning Winston Churchill&#39;s advance knowledge of the attack</p><p></p><h2>Death Undercover</h2><p>Bruno, chef de police in the French town of St Denis, is already busy with a case when the body of an undercover French Muslim cop is found in the woods, a man who called Bruno for help only hours before.

Taking up the offer of a cure for writer&#39;s block leads him &#39;to those places in your head that you can&#39;t get to on your own&#39; - and plunges him into a semi-dreamland inhabited by a bizarre combination of characters from myth and reality: the talking head of Orpheus; a lost love; the young girl of Vermeer&#39;s famous portrait - and a frequency of Medusas.</p><p>Russell Hoban is the author of many extraordinary novels including TURTLE DIARY, THE LION OF BOAZ-JACHIN AND JACHIN-BOAZ, KLEINZEIT, PILGERMANN, ANGELICA&#39;S GROTTO and AMARYLLIS NIGHT AND DAY, all available from Bloomsbury. He has also written some classic books for children including THE MOUSE AND HIS CHILD and THE FRANCES books. He lives in London.Again demonstrating the versatility and creative energy exhibited in Riddley Walker and Pilgermann, in this slim novel Hoban deals with existential questions: the mystery of existence, the nature of reality, the role of art. Combining satire and fantasy, and in poetic, Joycean language mixed with the vernacular, this narrative rewards the discerning reader. Herman Orff, a failed novelist who supports himself by doing cartoons for Classic Comics, is accosted by the blind head of Orpheus, his progenitor, "the first of your line." Through a series of metaphysical communications that lead to an odyssey through London and Amsterdam, Orff is gradually given to understand the connection between the women in his life: his lost love Luise von Himmelbett (symbolizing Eurydice); the nubile and very available Melanie Falsepercy (symbolizing Persephone); the print of Vermeer's Head of a Young Girl that hangs above his desk and haunts his imagination; and the head of Medusa in a painting by the Dutch master Frans Post: all represent "femaleness." Spare and witty, full of metaphorical, mythical and mystical allusions, the narrative sings with insights. At the same time whimsical, farcical (an advertising agency is called Slithe and Tovey) and deadly serious, it brilliantly relates the tragic ancient myths to the commonplace tragedies of modern life in a violent, dislocated age. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Creative Curriculum for Infants, Toddlers &amp; Twos (3 Volume Set)</h2><p>The three comprehensive volumes of The Creative Curriculum� for Infants, Toddlers, &amp; Twos, Second Edition, Revised, retain the focus on responsive care and incorporate 38 research-based objectives that enable teachers to focus on what matters most for very young children.

A wizard enters the underground domain of Ahra, high priestess of the Powers of the Earth, in an attempt to steal her palace&#39;s greatest treasure.</p><p>Often compared to Tolkien's Middle-earth or Lewis's Narnia, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea is a stunning fantasy world that grabs quickly at our hearts, pulling us deeply into its imaginary realms. Four books (<i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>, <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and <i>Tehanu</i>) tell the whole Earthsea cycle--a tale about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Le Guin challenges her readers to think about the power of language, how in the act of naming the world around us we actually create that world. Teens, especially, will be inspired by the way Le Guin allows her characters to evolve and grow into their own powers. <p> In this second book of Le Guin's Earthsea series, readers will meet Tenar, a priestess to the "Nameless Ones" who guard the catacombs of the Tombs of Atuan. Only Tenar knows the passageways of this dark labyrinth, and only <b>she</b> can lead the young wizard Sparrowhawk, who stumbles into its maze, to the greatest treasure of all. Will she?</p>Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea cycle has become one of the best-loved fantasies of our time. The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Middle Earth</i> or C.S. Lewis'<i>Narnia</i>. The magnificent saga begins with <i>A Wizard Of Earthsea</i>, continues in <i>The Tombs Of Atuan</i> and <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and concludes with <i>Tehanu</i> --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry. When she was still a child, Tenar was stripped of her name and family and dedicated as high priestess to the Nameless Ones, dark powers of <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>. This is the tale of the young wizard, Ged, who came to the forbidden labyrinth to steal its greatest treasure--the Ring of Erreth-Akbe--and stayed to set Tenar free and lead her out of darkness.</p><h2>Color for Interior Design</h2><p>A comprehensive introduction to the impact of color and the ways in which color can be strategically applied to enhance an environment features a history of interiors from a color perspective, an outline of color theory and science, and a guide on how to use color for decorating and special effects. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Ethel Rompilla is a professor of colour and an associate dean of the New York School of Interior Design in Manhattan. The recipient of numerous awards for her teaching of colour, she is also a practicing interior designer. Prior to her educational work, she was a designer with the firm of Hellmuth Obata Kassabaum Architects in New York and a collaborator with furniture designer Norman Diekman.Whether it was in a cave, an early Minoan palace or an American Federalist home, people have always looked to bring color and design into their living spaces. Both science and psychology influence the art of marrying style and pigment: "Nature has always provided the visual stimulation of color, light and texture, while history has shown the human need for variety and change," writes Rompilla in her breathless survey of 3000 years of architecture, art history, color theory and science. Complementing an eclectic assortment of 125 illustrations (including 95 in color), the text is concise, lucid and well-organized. Such an ambitious synthesis could have easily become either chaotic and dense or thin and overly simplistic, but Rompilla hits all the highlights and stays on point, even when covering Aristotle in a few lines: "He believed that the rainbow had only three fixed, or primary colors: red, green and blue (although yellow was visible), and he assigned these three primaries to pigment as well." Broad ranging despite its brevity, her introduction to the study and practice of color for interiors leaves the reader with the sense of the complexity and depth of the subject-and might inspire some to study further. Except for a few anomalies, such as an out-of-focus photograph of Josef Hoffmann's Palais Stoclet, the art is well-chosen, nicely reproduced and beautifully incorporated into the book's coffee-table format. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An Old English term for the Dark Age world, it was always assumed that the importance of magic in this world existed only in Tolkien`s works; now Professor Brian Bates reveals the vivid truth about this historical culture. Behind the stories we know of Dark Age king and queens, warriors and battles, lies the hidden history of Middle-earth, a world of magic, mystery and destiny. Fiery dragons were seen to fly across the sky, monsters haunted the marshes, and elves fired poisoned arrows. Wizards cast healing spells, wise trees gave blessings, and omens foretold the deaths of kings. The very landscape itself was enchanted and the world imbued with a life force.</p><p>Repressed by a millennium of Christianity, this belief system all but disappeared, leaving only faint traces in folk memory and fairy tales. In this remarkable book Professor Brian Bates has drawn on the latest archaeological findings to reconstruct the imaginative world of our past, revealing a culture with insights that may yet help us understand our own place in the world.</p></p><p><p>Brian Bates is professor of Psychology and Consciousness at the University of Sussex. He is a leading writer on the spiritual world of the Anglo-Saxon and Norse cultures. His previous book, co-authored with John Cleese, was The Human Face. He has also contributed to the Sunday Times, Observer and Express.</p></p><h2>The Art of Hitting</h2><p>The author, eight time National League batting champion, looks at the mechanics of hitting, including grip, stance, balance, footwork, release point, swing, and follow-through</p><p>Interesting that Ted Williams, possessor of the best batting average of the '40s and '50s, would pen the foreword to an exegesis by Gwynn, who has sported the best average since. Both Williams and Gwynn have their roots around San Diego, both have shelves of batting crowns, and both have been articulate, dogged students, and advocates of, their demanding craft. Interesting, too, that Williams would title his own acknowledged classic on the subject, <i>The Science of Hitting</i>, while Gwynn, who's relied less on power and more on cunning, and admits to having studied Williams like a graduate student preparing for orals, would focus more on the <i>art</i>. Interesting, too, the conversation that takes place between them here on what to do with the inside pitch; art and science don't easily agree.<p> Part memoir (when Gwynn got his first big-league hit against the Phillies in 1982, Pete Rose, playing first that night, congratulated him and then counseled, "Just don't try to catch me in one night") and part sound, conversationally proffered advice, Gwynn's liberally illustrated <i>Art</i> mirrors his persona: thoughtful, personable, and approachable. He breaks hitting down into its essential components--grip, stance, swing, and follow-through--but also builds on them intellectually and psychologically in his constant search for an edge. His analyses of pitchers--Greg Maddux, Randy Johnson, and Nolan Ryan among them--invite you into the chess match of the hitter-hurler confrontation. But it's his admission that he's "gladly taken less money to be where I'm happy"--with the Padres--rather than just take the money, change uniforms, and run, that may be his best hitting tip of all: a mind free of angst and greed can better concentrate on cut fastballs and dipping sliders. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Gwynn, a member of the San Diego Padres baseball team and the holder of multiple batting titles, is one of the finest hitters today. Though he proclaims hitting to be more of an art than a science, he diligently reviews his every at-bat to use his talent to its optimum. In this regard, he follows in the footsteps of the game's greatest scientific hitter, Ted Williams, who contributes the book's foreword. Gwynn's book may, in fact, be worthy of Williams's own classic, The Science of Hitting (LJ 6/1/71). Readers who want to learn more about what makes Gwynn tick will find the answers here, as his book is autobiographical as well as instructional. He is a family man who somehow remains modest and true to his roots. His hitting tips, accompanied by photos, are easy to follow, even as he tries to simplify the incomparably difficult process of hitting. With its large photos, readable type, and clear layout, this beautifully produced book would be useful to both the casual fan and the young slugger looking for guidance. Highly recommended for most libraries.?Paul M. Kaplan, Lake Villa Dist.

(suspense).</p><p>New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Heather Graham has written more than one hundred novels, many of which have been featured by the Doubleday Book Club and the Literary Guild. An avid scuba diver, ballroom dancer and mother of five, she still enjoys her south Florida home, but loves to travel as well, from locations such as Cairo, Egypt, to her own backyard, the Florida Keys.

She is very proud to be a Killerette in the Killer Thriller Band, along with many fellow novelists she greatly admires.<br><br>Jackson Crow sat staring at the pile of dossiers before him. This was his first meeting with the man on the other side of the desk: Adam Harrison, white haired, dignified, slim and a taste for designer suits. The office was modest, nicely appointed, but far from opulent. Plate-glass windows looked over row houses in Alexandria, Virginia, and other companies with shared space in the building had names such as Brickell and Sons, Attorneys-at-Law, Chase Real Estate and B. K. Blake, Criminal Investigation.<br><br>Adam had just handed him the folders. "Jackson, do you have any idea of why you're here?"<br><br>He'd returned to his old Behavioral Science Unit in D.C. to discover that he was being given a new assignment. His leave of absence, it seemed, was somehow permanent.<br><br>His last assignment, despite the excellent work done by him and his colleagues, had ended with three of them being dead. Yet if it hadn't been for his intuition, two other fellow agents might have died as well. Local police had not responded to the call sent out, and there was no way to blame himself. Naturally, he did.<br><br>Maybe the empathy of his superiors had caused them to give him a new assignment, in a different place&#x2014;behind a desk.<br><br>He'd heard things <em>about</em> Adam Harrison. He'd worked solo over the years&#x2014;and for the government where the government could not act officially. Adam went in where others did not.<br><br>It wasn't because of extreme danger. Rather, it might be considered that he went in because of extreme <em>weirdness.</em><br><br>"No," he said simply.<br><br>"First, let me assure you, you are not being let go. You will still be working for Uncle Sam," Adam told him. "The assignments will come from me, but you'll be heading up the team. A new team."<br><br><em>A cushy job somewhere behind a desk that didn't involve serial killers, kidnapping or bodies discovered beneath concrete.</em><br><br>Jackson wasn't sure how he felt; numb, perhaps.<br><br>"Take a look at this."<br><br>He hadn't had a chance to look at the files yet, but Adam now handed him a month-old New Orleans newspaper bearing the headline Wife of Senator David Hol-loway Dies from Fall into Courtyard.<br><br>He looked up at Adam.<br><br>"Read the full article," Adam suggested.<br><br>He read silently.<br><br>Regina Holloway, the wife of beloved state Senator David Holloway, died yesterday in a fall from a balcony at their recently purchased French Quarter mansion on Dauphine Street. Six months ago, the Holloways lost their only son, Jacob, in an accident on I-10. While there is speculation that Regina cast herself over the balcony, David Holloway has strenuously denied such a possibility; his wife was doing well and coming to terms with their loss; they were planning on building a family again.<br><br>The police and the coroner's office have yet to issue an official cause of death. The house, one of the grand old Spanish homes in the Quarter, was once the killing ground of the infamous Madden C. Newton, the "carpetbagger" responsible for the torture slayings of at least twenty people. Less than ten years ago, a teenager who had broken into the then-empty house also perished in a fall; the coroner's office ruled his death accidental. The alleged drug dealer had raced into the vacant house to elude police.<br><br>An uneasy feeling swept over Jackson, but he calmly set the newspaper back on the desk and looked at Adam Harrison.<br><br>"That's a tragic story," he said. "It sounds likely that the poor woman did commit suicide, and the senator is in denial. I'm afraid I've seen other instances in which a woman could not accept the loss of her child."<br><br>"Many people are insistent that the house is haunted," Adam said.<br><br>"And that a ghost committed this murder?" Jackson asked. He leaned forward in his chair. "I'm not at all sure I believe in ghosts, Adam. And if they did exist, wouldn't they be things of mist and imagination? Hardly capable of tossing a woman over a balcony."<br><br>"The senator has friends in high places, though he's still only a state senator. He absolutely insists that his wife did not commit suicide," Adam said.<br><br>"Does he suspect murder?" Jackson asked.<br><br>"The house was locked, no lower windows were open, and the gate to the courtyard was locked as well."<br><br>"Someone could have crawled over the wall or gotten through the gate," Jackson suggested.<br><br>Adam nodded. "That's possible, of course. But no witnesses have come forward in the past month to suggest that such a thing might have happened. The death was determined to be a suicide fairly quickly. Are you familiar with the city of New Orleans, the French Quarter or Vieux Carre, specifically?"<br><br>An ironic smile curled Jackson's features. "Land of vampires, ghosts, voodoo and fantasy. But some of the world's best cooking, and some truly great music, too."<br><br>"All right then. You work in behavioral science. Don't you agree that people's beliefs can create actions and reactions?"<br><br>"Yes, of course. Son of Sam... Berkowitz believed that howling dogs were demons commanding him to kill. Or, it was a damn good defense."<br><br>"Always a skeptic," Adam said. "And yet you're not really, are you?" Now, Adam smiled.<br><br>"I am a skeptic, yes. Am I open to possibility? Yes," Jackson said carefully.<br><br>"You know, both of your parents were amazing believers," Adam reminded him.<br><br>Jackson hesitated.<br><br>Yes, they had been believers, both of them, always believing in a higher power, and it didn't matter what path someone took to that power. Jeremiah Crow had been born a member of the Cheyenne Nation, although his ancestry had been so mixed God alone knew exactly what it was. He had loved the spiritualism of his People, and his mother had loved it as well. Nominally Anglican, his mother had once told him that religion wasn't bad; it was meant to be very good. Men corrupted religion; and a man's religious choice didn't matter in the least if it was his path to decency and remembering his fellow man.<br><br>But his maternal grandmother had come from the Highlands of Scotland, and her tales of witches and pixies and ghosts had filled his childhood. Maybe that's why it had been while he was in the Highlands, and not on his Native American dream quest, that he had found himself in a position to question life and death and eternity, and all that fell in between.<br><br>"You're here because you are the perfect man for this team, Jackson," Adam said. "You're not going to refuse to investigate what seems like the impossible, but you're also not going to assume a ghost is the culprit."<br><br>"All right. So you want me to go to New Orleans and find out exactly why this woman died? You do realize there's a good chance that, no matter what the husband wants to believe, she committed suicide."<br><br>"Here's the thing, Jackson, most people will believe that she committed suicide. It is the most obvious answer. But I want the truth. Senator Holloway has given his passion to many critical committees in our country. He has made things happen often when the rest of the country sits around twiddling its collective thumbs. He is a man who can weigh the economy and the environment, and come up with solutions. <em>He</em> wants the truth. He's young in politics, barely forty, and if he doesn't bury himself in grief, he will continue to serve the American people with something our politicians have lacked heavily in the past fifty years&#x2014;complete integrity. People in Washington need him, and I'm asking that you lead the group."<br><br>"If it's my assignment, I'll take it on." Jackson paused. "But...do I really need a unit?"<br><br>"I believe so. I'm giving you a group to dispel or perhaps prove the existence of ghosts in the house. They all have their expertise as investigators as well."<br><br>He was quiet, and Adam continued, "When several members of your last unit were killed, you got to the ranch house quickly enough to save Lawson and Do-natello. No one knew where the Pick-Man was killing his victims. No one knew that he had arranged for your agents to be at the ranch house."<br><br>Jackson felt his jaw lock, and despite the time he had taken for leave, he swallowed hard. They'd lost good agents. Among them Sally Jennings, forty-five, experienced, and yet vulnerable no matter how many years of service she had seen.<br><br>He'd felt that he'd seen Sally; dreamed that he'd seen her, standing there at the house.<br><br>And it had been that <em>dream</em> that had brought him to the ranch house, and there he had discovered that she had been the first to die.<br><br>"I shot the Pick-Man," he said. "He's dead."<br><br>"That was the only chance Lawson and Donatello had, since, had he seen you before you warned him and fired to kill, he'd have put that pick through Donatel-lo's chest," Adam said. "Trust me, I've watched you for years, Jackson. I actually knew your parents."<br><br>That was surprising.<br><br>Adam might well have known about the event when Jackson had been riding near Stirling, Scotland, and been thrown. His friends had gone on, thinking that he had left them; that he'd won the race and the bet. He'd encountered a stranger after, one who had saved his life. And then.<br><br>It had been long ago.<br><br>And yet, hell. He'd spent his life debunking ghost stories and dreams like the one he'd had. Finding the truth behind them. Proving that the plantation in Virginia was "haunted" by a cousin of the owner who wanted him out of the estate. Proving that there were no ghosts prowling the Rocky Mountains, that a human being named Andy Sitwell was the Pick-Man, even if he supposedly believed that the ghost of an old gold-seeking mountaineer was causing him to commit murder.<br><br>Six months had passed since he had shot and killed the Pick-Man. Six months in which he had tried to mourn the loss of his coworkers. He'd been back to Scotland to visit his mother's family, and he'd spent a month with his father's family&#x2014;helping them organize their new casinos and hotels.<br><br>But he was ready to get back into the kind of work for which he knew he had a talent. Digging. Following clues. Whether it meant studying history, people, beliefs or a trail of blood. He was good at it.<br><br>He had the mind for it, and the mind for the kind of unit Adam Harrison was putting together.<br><br>"I'm open to possibilities," he said to Adam. "Possibilities&#x2014;there are a lot of people out there manipulating spiritualism and making a lot of money off the concept of ghosts."<br><br>Adam smiled. "That's true, and I actually like your skepticism. As far as believing in ghosts, well, I do," he said. "But that's not important. I've got you scheduled for a flight into Louis Armstrong International Airport at nine tomorrow morning. Is that sufficient time to allow you to get your situation here in order?" His situation here?<br><br>The apartment in Crystal City had little in it. All right, a damn decent entertainment center because he loved music and old movies. A closet of adequate and workable clothing. Pictures of the family and friends he had lost.<br><br>He nodded. "Sure. What about these?" He lifted the file folders, the dossiers on his new unit. "When do I meet the crew?"<br><br>"They'll arrive tomorrow and Wednesday," Adam said. "You've got the dossiers; read up on them first. I figured you might want the house all to yourself for a few hours. Angela arrives first&#x2014;she'll get in tomorrow evening around six. You'll know who they all are when they arrive if you've done the reading." Adam stood, a clear sign that the interview had come to an end. "Thank you for taking this on," he said.<br><br>"Did I actually have a choice?" he asked with a rueful grin.<br><br>Adam returned the grin. Jackson was never really going to know.<br><br>He started out of the office. Adam called him back.<br><br>"You know, you have a gift for this, Jackson. And you can really take on anything you want."<br><br>Jackson wasn't sure what that meant, either. "I'll do my best," he promised.<br><br>"I know you will. And I know that we'll all know what really happened in that house on Dauphine."<br><br><em>X-Files.</em> The thought came to Jackson's mind as he finished with Adam Harrison.<br><br>He went down to his car, still wondering exactly what it was he was getting into.<br><br>Yeah, it was sounding like the <em>X-Files.</em> Or Ghost-files.<br><br>And he was going to have Ghost-file helpers. Great.<br><br>In his car, he glanced through the dossiers, scanning the main, introductory page of each. Angela Hawkins, Whitney Tremont, Jake Mallory, Jenna Duffy and Will Chan. The first woman, at least, was coming from a Virginia police force. Whitney Tremont had started out life in the French Quarter; she had a Creole background and had recently done the camera work for a paranormal cable-television show. Jake Mallory&#x2014;musician, but a man who had been heavily involved in searches after the summer of storms, and been called in as well during kidnapping cases and disappearances. Then there was Jenna Duffy. A registered nurse from Ireland. Well, they'd be covered in case of any poltergeist attacks. And Will Chan&#x2014;the man had worked in theater, and as a <em>magician.</em><br><br>It was one hell of a strange team.<br><br>Whatever, Jackson figured; it was time he went back to work. There was one thing he'd discovered to be correct&#x2014;the <em>truth</em> was always out there, you just had to find it.<br><br></p><h2>Classic Golf Instruction</h2><p>For improving the all-around game of every level of golfer&#x2014;in which excellent shotmaking technique takes precedence over big swings and the latest equipment fads&#x2014;there is no better teacher than Ravielli, who worked closely with such pros as Tom Watson, Bobby Jones, Sam Sneed, and Ben Hogan to offer the most lucid principles and easily explained demonstrations of shotmaking.

As with his music, the use of chance operations--in particular via the Chinese <i>Book of Changes</i>, or <i>I Ching</i>--was central to Cage's approach to visual art, determining technique, the placement of forms and even tonal values. <i>Every Day is a Good Day</i> provides the first broad assessment of Cage's art, and is fully illustrated with plates of his drawings, watercolors and prints, including series such as <i>Where R=Ryoanji</i> (1983-92). Cage's working methods and philosophies are brought to light in new interviews with key collaborators: printmaker and writer Kathan Brown, founder of Crown Point Press; Laura Kuhn, Director of the John Cage Trust; artist Ray Kass; and Julie Lazar, curator of Cage's composition for a museum, <i>Rolywholyover: A Circus</i>. Extracts from a 1966 interview between John Cage and critic Irving Sandler are also reproduced. At the heart of the book is a "Companion to John Cage," a selection of quotes by Cage and notes on key themes and influences, all of which make it essential reading on this important figure of the twentieth-century avant garde.</p><p>Jeremy Millar is an artist and AHRC Research Fellow in the Creative and Performing Arts at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, University of Oxford.

We have long known that fossils of sophisticated marine life-forms existed at the dawn of the Cambrian Period, but until recently scientists had found no traces of Precambrian fossils. The quest to find such traces began in earnest in the mid-1960s and culminated in one dramatic moment in 1993 when William Schopf identified fossilized microorganisms three and a half <i>billion</i> years old. This startling find opened up a vast period of time--some eighty-five percent of Earth's history--to new research and new ideas about life's beginnings. In this book, William Schopf, a pioneer of modern paleobiology, tells for the first time the exciting and fascinating story of the origins and earliest evolution of life and how that story has been unearthed.</p><br><p> Gracefully blending his personal story of discovery with the basics needed to understand the astonishing science he describes, Schopf has produced an introduction to paleobiology for the interested reader as well as a primer for beginning students in the field. He considers such questions as how did primitive bacteria, pond scum, evolve into the complex life-forms found at the beginning of the Cambrian Period? How do scientists identify ancient microbes and what do these tiny creatures tell us about the environment of the early Earth? (And, in a related chapter, Schopf discusses his role in the controversy that swirls around recent claims of fossils in the famed meteorite from Mars.) Like all great teachers, Schopf teaches the non-specialist enough about his subject along the way that we can easily follow his descriptions of the geology, biology, and chemistry behind these discoveries. Anyone interested in the intriguing questions of the origins of life on Earth and how those origins have been discovered will find this story the best place to start.</p></p><p>What if U.S. history began in 1963, and everything that happened before that year was shrouded in mystery? There would be plenty of events to study, but we wouldn't have a complete picture of the country's past. This is the analogy that paleomicrobiologist J.&nbsp;William Schopf uses to describe the long-missing 85&nbsp;percent of earth's early fossil record (the puzzle of the missing fossils was known as Darwin's Dilemma). Not until the 1960s did paleobiologists using pickaxes and microscopes find evidence that life began much earlier than previously theorized and that microorganisms were the planet's only inhabitants for most of its existence. And Schopf himself discovered the oldest Precambrian fossils known to science in 1993. Why did it take so long to find these critters? <blockquote>Though the puzzle of the "missing" early fossil record lived on for more than a hundred years, its solution is now so obvious as to be mundane. The Precambrian world did <i>indeed</i> swarm with living creatures, but until near the close of this vast eon these were microbes and microalgal cells so tiny and fragile that they would never have been unearthed by conventional fossil hunting.</blockquote> <i>Cradle of Life</i> is a great primer for those interested in the fossil record and its relation to evolutionary theory. Profusely illustrated, this chronicle of amazing discoveries and bizarre questions covers wide ground, including the basics of cell biology and microevolution as well as the careers of the big-name scientists who have set the fossil record straight. And the search continues for the origins of life on earth, as well as the hints of it elsewhere. In a terrifically enlightening epilogue, Schopf shows how even the best scientists have been fooled by geological artifacts that resemble true fossils (as happened with the infamous Martian meteorite "bacteria") and by their own desires to confirm their theories and beliefs about the origins of life. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p>"'I am born,' writes Dicken's David Copperfield, in simple statement of fact. Our knowledge of how the first cells and organisms were begotten is far less resolute. With focused vision, <i>Cradle of Life</i> probes one view of primordial Earth and the succor of its first cells and organisms, even as scientists explore and assemble evidence to advocate other possibilities. Schopf engages the reader with the magic of storytelling as he writes about such matters as the fables and foibles of scientists, the demands of discovery and documentation in attaining an understanding of how life evolved, the tempo of evolution, and, of course, the continuing saga of the Mars rocks."--<b>Cindy Lee Van Dover, author of <i>Deep-Ocean Journeys</i></b></p><p>"An entertaining and informative book. It provides an interesting perspective on how science is done. . . . Schopf's personal perspective provides a sense of the personalities involved and engages the reader. . . ."--<b>Dawn Y.

"All truth is paradox," Lamott writes, "and this turns out to be a reason for hope. If you arrive at a place in life that is miserable, it will change." That is the time when we must pledge not to give up but "to do what Wendell Berry wrote: 'Be joyful, though you have considered all the facts.'" <br><br>In this profound and funny book, Lamott calls for each of us to rediscover the nuggets of hope and wisdom that are buried within us that can make life sweeter than we ever imagined.

Epic baseball feats offered welcome relief from the hardships of daily life. The Gashouse Gang, the brilliant culmination of a dream by its general manager, Branch Rickey, the first to envision a farm system that would acquire and "educate" young players in the art of baseball, was adored by the nation, who saw itself&#x2014;scruffy, proud, and unbeatable&#x2014;in the Gang.</p><p> Based on original research and told in entertaining narrative style, <i>The Gashouse Gang</i> brings a bygone era and a cast full of vivid personalities to life and unearths a treasure trove of baseball lore that will delight any fan of the great American pastime.</p></p><p><b>John Heidenry</b> is a native of St. Louis and was the founding editor, in 1977, of <i>St. Louis</i> magazine and the <i>St. Louis Literary Supplement</i>. He is currently the Executive Editor of <i>The Week</i>. The author of several previous books, he lives in New York City.Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley<p>Seventy-three years ago, the St. Louis Cardinals did what they did only six months ago: They beat the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. But just about all resemblances end there. In 1934 the teams were lily-white, the players mostly were only of average size, their wages were low, they played in relatively primitive ballparks, they traveled between cities by train, they smoked and were featured in cigarette ads, and the game they played dominated the American sports scene with no real competition beyond intercollegiate football.</p><p>Furthermore, they played at a time when the United States was in an economic crisis almost unimaginable today. The Great Depression had "reached rock bottom," John Heidenry writes, with "massive unemployment, mile-long bread lines, and the westward migration that began when Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, and Arkansas turned into a giant Dust Bowl." The country was almost as desperately in need of distraction and amusement as of jobs and economic recovery. As the 1934 major league baseball season unfolded, Americans got a measure of what they needed from the Cardinals. Not until the season had ended were they christened the Gashouse Gang, but from the first pitch, they had the ingredients of baseball legend:</p><p>"They were the unique product of a particular time and place -- mostly men who had known extreme poverty and hardship in the South and West, with a few hard-nosed kids from eastern states thrown in for variety. Among their number were a couple of ex-sharecroppers, a pool shark, a handsome dandy who worked as a Hollywood double in the off-season, a grease-stained third baseman who liked to drive his midget auto racer around a track before a game, a surly outfielder who punched any of his own teammates if they looked at him in the wrong way, and even a couple of college kids. Collectively, as the Gashouse Gang, they were the creation of a pious, nonimbibing Methodist who would not even watch them play on a Sunday because his religious principles forbade it." </p><p>That pious gentleman was Branch Rickey, the team's general manager, who is now best known as the man who brought Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Then, though, he was in his mid-50s and still making his way in the game. He had found his way to the Cardinals a couple of decades earlier, when they were a marginal team on the edge of bankruptcy, and had turned them into one of the three or four dominant teams in the National League. This was largely because in 1919 he'd had the vision to realize that a low-budget, small-city team could compete with New York and Chicago if it set up a chain of minor-league teams to train young players and feed them into the big-league team when they were ready, all of this at significantly less cost than purchasing established players for $100,000 or more -- a huge sum at the time.</p><p>Fifteen of the 25 players on the 1934 Cardinals had been trained in the farm system, most notably the brilliant and wildly eccentric pitcher Jerome Herman "Dizzy" Dean. He had come out of the Arkansas Ozarks, poorly educated, dressed in rags, hillbilly to the core -- but also a born baseball player and a much smarter guy than appearances suggested. He was "the unofficial ringleader" of the Cardinals, even though some of his teammates thought he was a blowhard; they knew, as he did, that "when he was in peak form, he was unbeatable," and they suffered his antics as the price of his pitching genius: "Though Dizzy was a braggart and a practical joker, and sometimes just plain obnoxious, the consensus among many of his teammates was that, at heart, he was a good fellow." He won 30 games that year, which made him the last 30-game winner until Denny McLain of the Tigers won 31 three-and-a-half decades later. </p><p>He feuded with just about everybody, from Sam Breadon, the owner, right on down. His relationship with Joe "Ducky" Medwick was especially fractious, but then Medwick was -- apart from being a talented hitter and outfielder -- a difficult guy, a loner who was quick to get angry. He had joined the team near the end of the 1932 season and immediately "criticized any teammate who, in his opinion, made a foolish error." He made people mad, "yet none of the players confronted Medwick to his face. He was clearly a man no one wanted to get into a fistfight with." </p><p>But that's how ballplayers were in those days. The game was rough, and the players were rougher. The 1934 Cardinals may have been especially boisterous and rambunctious, but their behavior wasn't unusual in a game played mostly by country boys in a nation still heavily rural. The New York Giants, managed by the incomparably feisty John McGraw, were of similar character. </p><p>The Cardinals were managed by Frank Frisch, who was in his mid-30s and one of the greatest second basemen the game had known. In his youth, he'd had remarkable speed, and he'd gone to college at Fordham -- hence, in an era when the press gave every player a nickname, "the Fordham Flash" -- and a rather dignified manner, at least by baseball standards. He was "someone who could appreciate fine wine, art, and literature," so it was inevitable that he'd cross swords with Dean, who "liked to read pulp adventure novels about cowboys, preferred nightclubs to museums, and was forever harassing, pestering, and negotiating with the front office, which he loudly and publicly accused of being cheap and exploitative." It finally reached the point where Dean decided to go on strike over what he regarded as inadequate wages, and he insisted that his younger brother Paul walk out with him. Paul -- who won 19 games that year and pitched exceptionally well in the World Series -- seems to have been a somewhat reluctant protester, but he tagged along when Dizzy orchestrated his "two-person mutiny," which "was like nothing the game had ever seen." It lasted only about a week, and the Deans predictably didn't get what they wanted. However the other players may have felt about the walkout, they had to concede that "in the final stretch, the Dean brothers became virtually invincible." As did the Cardinals themselves. They won 20 of their last 25 regular-season games and won the league championship -- the "gonfalon," as sportswriters of the day liked to call the pennant -- on the last day from the Giants, who became the first team to squander a seven-game lead going into September. They then went on to take the Tigers in seven games, including three wins on Detroit's home field. Both Deans pitched well, and Dizzy was his usual irrepressible self.</p><p>Heidenry has told this familiar tale competently but with little flair. He is a native of St. Louis, not quite old enough to have seen the Gashouse Gang in person, who has held various journalistic positions over the years and now lives in New York. His love for the Cardinals is obvious -- the only Midwesterners who don't love the Cardinals would appear to be the ones who love the Chicago Cubs -- but it doesn't translate into peppy prose or smooth narrative. He relies far too much on sportswriters of the day and quotes them to excess, especially the dreary, clich�d John Drebinger of the New York Times, whom I am old enough to have read more often than I care to remember. He does have the grace and candor to admit that he wasn't able to find out for certain where "Gashouse Gang" came from, but then neither has anyone else. Let's just say it sounds right, even if no one knows what it means, and leave it at that.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

I could flick him off and tell him to go to hell. Then I could fist-bump the angel sitting on my right shoulder and get on with doing all the things God has called me to do. That would change everything.<br><br>I&#x2019;d discover an unshakable confidence. It wouldn&#x2019;t be borrowed from the ever-changing assessments of others. I would instinctively offer my weaknesses as a platform for God&#x2019;s power instead of typecasting myself as someone God<br>couldn&#x2019;t use due to my endless character flaws.<br><br>I&#x2019;d be unstoppable because the devil wouldn&#x2019;t be able to dominate my mind with the kinds of fears that control me a lot of the time. Then I would be able to move forward in faith without being scared of failure or rejection or the sacrifice required to obey God.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never again be paralyzed by condemnation or bullied by feelings of unworthiness. And at the end of each day I&#x2019;d go to sleep in perfect peace because I&#x2019;d be finishing the day with no shame, no regrets, no need to sew any fig leaves to conceal anything.<br><br>I&#x2019;d be nearly immune from discouragement, because I would stop wondering if the sky was falling every time I faced a new challenge. I&#x2019;d see my biggest obstacles as my greatest opportunities...and all the other stuff you read on Starbucks cups.<br><br>Unfortunately, there&#x2019;s no devil on my shoulder.<br><br>What&#x2019;s worse, there&#x2019;s no angel either.<br><br>Instead, I&#x2019;ve got this ceaseless war going on inside my heart and my head. I&#x2019;m waging it every millisecond of every minute of every hour of every day&#x2014;nights, holidays, and weekends too.<br><br>####<br><br>I wake up every day to the crow of the chatterbox.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s a transcript of my internal dialogue from a recent morning. It&#x2019;s a real-time example of the kind of chatter that can derail my day before it even gets started. Sometimes over the most ridiculous things you can imagine.<br><br>The thoughts are flying so fast now that I can&#x2019;t keep track, much less sort them out and put them where they belong. Thinking about these thoughts at all only seems to feed them. That&#x2019;s why they keep overpowering me, because I keep feeding them. I know this, but it never stops me from doing it. Not this time, not ten years ago, and it won&#x2019;t be any different ten years from now, I&#x2019;m beginning to believe.<br><br>This is so stupid. I&#x2019;m being so stupid.<br><br>It&#x2019;s only a light bulb.<br><br>A burned-out light bulb has turned into a mini-midmorning meltdown in my mind, and I can&#x2019;t find the switch to shut it off. The meltdown, I mean, not the light bulb.<br><br>So I&#x2019;m standing in the shower, and the light bulb is out, and it&#x2019;s like the sky is falling.<br><br>As soon as I stepped into the shower, I noticed, for the third time, that the middle bulb was out over the sink on the other side of the bathroom. Now that I&#x2019;m in the shower, stranded, phoneless, how am I going to put in Evernote that the light bulb is out? With my pathetic attention span, what are the chances I&#x2019;ll remember to replace the light bulb after I get out?<br><br>I definitely don&#x2019;t have time to change the light bulb&#x2014;I&#x2019;m already going to be ten minutes late for this meeting. If there&#x2019;s no traffic. I&#x2019;m always running late for meetings. I&#x2019;m a late person. It&#x2019;s because I hit the snooze button three times every morning, because I&#x2019;m spiritually apathetic. Pastor Mickey used to get up at 5 a.m. and spend two hours with God, and he said, &#x201c;He who runs from God in the morning will scarce find Him throughout the day.&#x201d; They should put that on a Starbucks cup too.<br><br>Either way, God is gone for the day, and it&#x2019;s not even 9 a.m. And now I&#x2019;m running twelve minutes late, and the light bulb is still out.<br><br>I&#x2019;m screwed.<br><br>And who am I kidding? Even if I had time to change the light bulb, yeah, right, like I have a clue where Holly keeps them. Now that&#x2019;s really pathetic. What would people think if they found out about that one: the woman changes all the light bulbs around that house! What kind of example am I setting for my kids?<br><br>Did I even pray with the kids last night? the night before that?<br><br>Dunno. But I did Instagram that sunset shot with the kids at the creek last Friday. So there&#x2019;s that.<br><br>&#x201c;Cock-a-doodle-do.&#x201d; The chatterbox informs me that I&#x2019;m fourteen minutes late...and I suck as a person.<br><br>I&#x2019;m feeding the machine, and it&#x2019;s eating me alive.<br><br>And the chatter will continue to race through my mind until I decide to downshift and put things back in perspective: Calm down, Furtick. It&#x2019;s. Just. A. Light bulb.<br><br>Just like that, if only for a split second, the chatterbox gives way. And I get on with my day. <br><br>Unfortunately, it won&#x2019;t be long until the chatterbox sounds off again. Probably next time about something much more serious than a light bulb. So much doubt, panic, raw impulse, and bogus conjecture stream through my mind. My<br>soul sometimes feels like a Twitter feed where I&#x2019;m following a million of the most annoying people ever, and I can&#x2019;t find the Unfollow button.<br><br>####<br><br>But God is faithful to speak too. His voice rises from the pages of His Word, which is the exact expression of His will. He speaks, not only on Sunday mornings in the sanctuary where the congregation is gathered, but also in the stillness<br>of His works scattered across the night skies. His Spirit speaks with promptings that are not audible&#x2014;often they are much louder than that&#x2014;always in perfect harmony with the Scriptures and always resounding with perfect wisdom.<br><br>And in every season of my life, God has sent reminders to confirm that He has perfectly designed me and totally enabled me for everything He&#x2019;s called me to do. Sometimes He&#x2019;ll do that through a simple picture, song, text, or conversation that rings with affirmation for days.<br><br>Other times, at critical junctures, God has spoken dramatic words of encouragement over my life.<br><br>A few years ago I was on a plane headed home, and I looked out the window during the descent. The sunset seemed to be painting the skyline in neon orange, illuminating the city where I had just moved to start a church. It was a glowing visual that set the scene for God to speak to my heart: This is your city. I&#x2019;ve called you here to pour out your life for My cause. Be confident, because everywhere you set your foot belongs to Me, and you belong to Me, and together we&#x2019;re going to take this city for My glory.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sure my translation of this conversation isn&#x2019;t word perfect, because you know how tricky cross-cultural communication with God can be. Plus, I can&#x2019;t find the notebook where I frantically scribbled every word of those impressions. The part I&#x2019;m sure of is that I heard God encouraging me at a time when I really needed it. We were only a couple of months into getting our new church off the ground. I needed some reassurance, and God delivered.<br><br>And it was His voice piercing through the roar of my doubts that lifted my perspective. It was just enough to keep me moving forward in faith.<br><br>####<br><br>Now I&#x2019;d like to ask you a few questions.<br><br>Is it possible to be the kind of person who can be distracted to the point of utter despair by a blown light bulb and still hear God calling you to do great things as you stare down at your city through a sunset?<br><br>Can God&#x2019;s voice coexist with maniacal chatter&#x2014;within the same person?<br><br>And how can I silence the voice of the enemy when the enemy is in me? Can you relate to this contradiction?<br><br>I used to think that someone who struggled with the kinds of weaknesses I deal with daily was useless to God. I felt so often like I was drowning in internal dialogue I couldn&#x2019;t control. It had been the soundtrack of my life for as long as I could remember. I had hoped these problems would finally be fixed when I became a committed Christian. And I hoped for it again each time I experienced spiritual highs along the way in my journey of faith.<br><br>But the beat went on.<br><br>Yet everything changed when I began to realize God has given us the ability to choose the dialogue we believe and respond to. And once we learn how, we can switch from lies to truth as deliberately as we can choose the Beatles over Miley Cyrus on satellite radio.<br><br>Choosing to believe this, moment by moment, and acting on it is the most important habit you will ever develop. It is the key to pressing ahead and doing God&#x2019;s will anyway, even as you are bombarded with thoughts, feelings, and even facts about why you can&#x2019;t do it. Why you shouldn&#x2019;t do it. And why you&#x2019;ll never be able to do it. Why you&#x2019;re too dysfunctional, too petty, too immature, too melancholy, too impulsive... <br><br>I&#x2019;m now awakening to the reality that we can access the power of God&#x2019;s promises to constantly crash the system of our broken beliefs. I&#x2019;m learning how to overpower the shouts of the Enemy by bending my ear to the whisper of God&#x2019;s supernatural truths about my identity in Him and His strength in me. This isn&#x2019;t something I did once and now it&#x2019;s over or something I can afford to do occasionally when it&#x2019;s convenient. It requires constancy. It&#x2019;s the only way I know to be the father, husband, leader, friend, and believer that God says I already am, the kind of person I am straining to believe I can become. Winning the war of words inside your soul means learning to defy your inner critic. But that&#x2019;s easier said than done. And I think many times, as believers, we sense we are losing this war. But we don&#x2019;t know what to do about it because we don&#x2019;t know where to find the weapons, and we wouldn&#x2019;t know where to aim them if we did.<br><br>In other words, we feel powerless to crash the chatterbox. And now would probably be a good time to explain exactly what I mean by that.</p><h2>Concrete Island</h2><p><p>Robert Maitland, a 35 year-old architect, is driving home from his London offices when a blow-out sends his speeding Jaguar hurtling out of control.

People trust the recommendation of a friend, family member, colleague, or even stranger with similar tastes over anything thrust at them by a faceless company. <br><br> Most business owners believe that whether customers refer them is entirely out of their hands. But science shows that people can't help recommending products and services to their friends-it's an instinct wired deep in the brain. And smart businesses can tap into that hardwired desire. <br><br> Marketing expert John Jantsch offers practical techniques for harnessing the power of referrals to ensure a steady flow of new customers. Keep those customers happy, and they will refer your business to even more customers. Some of Jantsch's strategies include: <br><br> -<b>Talk with your customers, not at them.</b> Thanks to social networking sites, companies of any size have the opportunity to engage with their customers on their home turf as never before-but the key is listening. <br><br> -<b>The sales team is the most important part of your marketing team.</b> Salespeople are the company's main link to customers, who are the main source of referrals. Getting them on board with your referral strategy is critical. <br><br> -<b>Educate your customers.</b> Referrals are only helpful if they're given to the right people. Educate your customers about whom they should be talking to. <br><br> The secret to generating referrals lies in understanding the "Customer Referral Cycle"-the way customers refer others to your company who, in turn, generate even more referrals. Businesses can ensure a healthy referral cycle by moving customers and prospects along the path of Know, Like, Trust, Try, Buy, Repeat, and Refer. If everyone in an organization keeps this sequence in mind, Jantsch argues, your business will generate referrals like a well-oiled machine. <br><br> This practical, smart, and original guide is essential reading for any company looking to grow without a fat marketing budget.</p><p><b>John Jantsch</b>&nbsp;is a marketing consultant, speaker, and the acclaimed author of&nbsp;<i>Duct Tape Marketing</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Commitment Engine,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Referral Engine</i>. He is the founder of the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network. He lives in Kansas City.As lean times force businesses to reduce advertising and marketing budgets, more and more companies are trying to develop new clients through word-of-mouth referrals. Jantsch (<i>Duct Tape Marketing</i>) champions such an approach, asserting that many widely referred businesses do very little when it comes to traditional advertising and that happy customers and actively engaged partners account for a great deal of their efforts. According to Jantsch, referral behavior is a primal activity rooted in our survival instinct and satisfying our need to connect with other people and mint social currency. Jantsch offers practical solutions on how to build a powerful referral engine by developing a systematic, consistent, and replicable approach and exploiting content, using social networking, and building strategic partnerships. He illustrates his points with examples from such companies as work clothing manufacturer Carhartt with its Tough Jobs blog; Southwest Airlines, which relies heavily on hiring the right people to be the champions of the brand; and TerraCycle, a recycling company whose nontraditional business practices generated word-of-mouth attention.

Ross uses a variety of unusual angles and lighting in his work that capture these glorious interiors in a fresh manner that will encourage you to beautify everything from the walls of your bedroom to the legs of your creaky old footstool. Patterns from Zulu baskets, Ewe cloth, Ashanti Adinkra symbols, and Asoke textiles are used with flair in every corner.

It hits home for us because it points straight to what it feels like not to be taken seriously: a bit like when I get lectured on Roman history on Twitter. Britain&#39;s best-known classicist Mary Beard, is also a committed and vocal feminist. With wry wit, she revisits the gender agenda and shows how history has treated powerful women. Her examples range from the classical world to the modern day, from Medusa and Athena to Theresa May and Elizabeth Warren. Beard explores the cultural underpinnings of misogyny, considering the public voice of women, our cultural assumptions about women&#39;s relationship with power, and how powerful women resist being packaged into a male template. With personal reflections on her own experiences of the sexism and gendered aggression she has endured online, Mary asks: if women aren&#39;t perceived to be within the structures of power, isn&#39;t it power that we need to redefine?

If you're familiar with the series (and if you're not, start with <i>The Demon Awakens</i>), you know that this ain't Icewind Dale. The generously developed characters take center stage, and they--much to our initial dismay, perhaps--are far from invincible. (More than a few hearts were broken when Elbryan the Nightbird, Touel'alfar-trained ranger extraordinaire, bit the dust in the last book, <i>Demon Apostle</i>.)<p> <i>Mortalis</i> shifts the spotlight to fearsome gemstone-wielder Jilseponie (a.k.a. Pony), who's got to decide just what path to take in the wake of Markwart/Bestesbulzibar's defeat and the death of her beloved ranger hubby. Should she take over the Abellican church as Mother Abbess? Or should she take King Danube's offer to be Baroness of Palmaris? Or perhaps her grief-tinged destiny lies along another path. Countless goblins still require a firm beating down, the ranks of the Abellicans are far from content, and a virulent plague threatens to kill off even more characters.

One of three foundation books of Chinese medicine, no translation of it has been available - until now. The Nei Jing (Inner Classic) established the theoretical foundations of TCM, especially acupuncture and moxibustion. The Shen Nong Ben Cao jing laid the foundation for the study of Chinese medicinals. And the Shang Han Lun/Jin Gui Yao Lue (Treatise on Damage [Due to] Cold/Essentials of the Golden Cabinet) is the locus classicus for Chinese formulas and prescriptions and treatment based on pattern discrimination. Translations of the Nei Jing and Shang Han Lun/Jin Gui Yao Lue have long exsisted in English. Now, with this book, all serious students and practitioners of Chinese medicine can have access to all of the three pillars of Chinese medicine.</p><p>Publisher's Foreword The Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (The Divine Farmer's Materia Medica Classic) is one of the 10 premodern classics of Chinese medicine selected in the People's Republic of China as nationwide research priorities within the Chinese medical literature. Also referred to as the Shen Nong Ben Jing, the Shen Nong Ben Cao, the Ben Cao Jing, and simply the Ben Jing, it is one of the two most important of these 10 preeminent Chinese medical classics. The Huang Di Nei Jing (The Yellow Emperior's Inner Classic) is the locus classicus of Chinese medical theory and especially acupuncture and moxibustion, while the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing is the locus classicus of so-called Chinese herbal medicine. All the rest of the Chinese medical literature, both premodern and contemporary, is built on the foundation of these two seminal texts. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why we have chosen to publish this first English language translation of the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing as part of Blue Poppy Press's Great Masters Series. <p>Shen Nong is one of the three greatest heroes of Chinese culture, the other two being the Yellow Emperor and Fu Xi, the revealer of the eight trigrams. These three legendary divine beings are credited as being the fountainhead of Chinese lifearts. The name Shen Nong can be translated as Divine Farmer, Divine Peasant, Divine Agriculturist, or Divine Husbandman. Among his numerous discoveries and revelations, Shen Nong is credited with teaching the Chinese people how to farm -- thus his most common name. The first reference to a connection between Shen Nong and Chinese herbal medicine is found in the Huai Nan Zi (The South of the Huai Master) written by Liu An who died in 122 bce. </p><p>"Ancient people ate grasses and drank water. They gathered the fruit from trees and ate the meat of clams. They frequently suffered from disease and poisoning. Then Shen Nong taught people for the first time how to sow the five grains, to observe whether the land was dry or wet, fertile or rocky, located in the hills or in the lowlands. He tasted the flavors of all the herbs and springs, [determining] whether they were bitter or sweet. Thus he taught people what to avoid and where they could go. At that time, [Shen Nong] encountered 70 [herbs] in one day, [determining which were] medicines and [which were] poisons." </p><p>This is the first surviving recorded instance in the Chinese literature crediting Shen Nong with determining the medicinal properties of things by tasting them himself. This story has then been repeated and embellished upon down through the centuries. Some versions even give Shen Nong a see-through stomach so he could witness the effects of what he ate on his internal organs! </p><p>The words ben and cao mean tree roots and grasses or herbs respectively. Therefore, as a compound term, they generically refer to the Chinese materia medica, and materia medica is the most commonly used translation of ben cao used in Engish today. Ben and cao are used in Chinese medicine to refer to materia medica in general because the overwhelming majority of traditional Chinese medicinals are dervied from vegetable sources. However, since the Chinese materia medica also includes mineral and animal medicinals, we have used the words, "so-called Chinese herbal medicine," above. </p><p>As mentioned previously, this work is the locus classicus of the ben cao or materia medica literature of Chinese medicine. It is this literature which describes the ingredients of Chinese medicine, their flavors and natures (i.e., temperatures), their functions, and indications. According to this book, medicinals have five basic flavors -- sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and acrid -- and four qi or natures -- cold, hot, warm, and cool. Hot diseases should be treated with cold medicinals and cold diseases should be treated with hot medicinals. This book also introduced the first method of classifying Chinese medicinals. Within this classic, all medicinals are classified into three grades or categories: superior medicinals corresponding to heaven which govern the maintenance of life and are without toxicity, medium medicinals corresponding to humankind which benefit human nature and have some medicinal functions, and inferior medicinals corresponding to earth which cure disease and definitely do have some toxicity. Further, medicinals are also categorized into sovereigns, ministers, assistants, and envoys. Hence, one can find all the most basic and elemental theories of Chinese herbal medicine in seminal form in this classic.</p></p><h2>De Colores and Other Latin American Folksongs for Children</h2><p>Reflecting the rich cultural traditions of Latin America, an illustrated treasury of twenty-five songs, chants, and musical games furnishes both Spanish and English lyrics, as well as musical arrangements for piano, voice, and guitar.</p><p>Jose-Luis Orozco is a bilingual children's performer, recording artist, and author who makes appearances nationwide. He lives in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;<br><br>Elisa Kleven grew up making dollhouses and collages out of doilies and postage stamps. Today, she is thrilled to carry on building her artistic dream worlds in the form of beautiful picture books. Elisa lives in Berkeley, California.Ages 2-8. Selected, arranged, and translated by popular Mexican performer and songwriter Orozco, this bilingual collection of Latin American folk songs for children is truly a musical treasure. Each of the 27 songs is presented with background notes; lyrics in both Spanish and English; simple arrangements for the voice, piano, and guitar; and suggestions for group sing-alongs and musical games. Gathered from Spanish-speaking countries but including two of Orozco's own songs, the compilation is a programming gold mine. Included are songs for special occasions ("La pi{�}nata"), counting songs ("El chocolate"), and animal songs ("La ara{�}na peque{�}nita"--"The Eensy, Weensy Spider" in Spanish!). There is even a handy subject index to locate appropriate songs. The book is a delight for the eye as well as the ear. In the same shimmering style of magical folk art that she used to illustrate Arthur Dorros' Abuela (1991), Kleven provides bountiful illustrations--the endpapers are sunshine bright with a crisp quilt of yellow flowers, and playful borders that ripple with colorful patterns and miniature pictures line the edge of every page. Full-page scenes of Hispanic families and children and also animals are exuberant with activity and alive with the joy of music. Multicultural collections have been clamoring for books such as this, which works both as a well-crafted resource and a rich and resonant children's book. <i>Annie Ayres</i></p><h2>Nelly Don: A Stitch In Time</h2><p>Book by Terence Michael O&#39;Malley</p><p></p><h2>The Clock Winder</h2><p>Having sacked her handyman, newly-widowed Mrs Emerson finds a replacement in Elizabeth, a lanky, awkward girl.

For all its sombre theme of childhood innocence exposed to a corrupted adult world, this novel is one of James&#39;s comic masterpieces. The outrageous behaviour of the characters on the seedy fringes of the English upper class is conveyed with wit and relish. The dual perspective of a sophisticated narrator richly appreciative of the absurdities of the adult sexual merry-go-round and the candid vision of Maisie, &#39;rebounding&#39; from one parent to another like a &#39;shuttlecock&#39;, together create an &#39;associational magic&#39;.

He suggests that, to enjoy restful sleep, we need to understand more about the nature of the mind and the body, the connections between them and the cycles of nature that are related to sleep patterns. Unlike many sleep specialists, he recommends staying in bed, with one's eyes closed, rather than getting up to read or watch television on those exasperating nights when sleep just doesn't come. He also advocates keeping sleeping logs, gentle daily exercise and discovering and nurturing one's Ayurvedic body type. The latter, understandably exotic to an audience accustomed to Western medicine, is based on three body types-vata, pitta, and kapha-and finding the inner harmony necessary for one's body type. Although not all insomniacs will go along with the Ayurvedic way of thinking, this approach does provide thought-provoking reading-especially on a sleepless night.

But Andrew Skinner shows in his introduction to this edition that the real sophistication of The Wealth of Nations lies less in its overall picture of a vast analytical system - a capitalist economy - in which all the parts can be seen simultaneously interacting with each other. Moreover, he stresses that Smith's view of society was mot a merely economic one, and that The Wealth of Nations is for from being an apologia for unregulated business enterprise: Smith was at pains to show that economic advance can have undesirable social consequences, and that labour which is economically unproductive can be beneficial to society at large.</p><p></p><h2>Broadway &amp; Hollywood: Costumes designed by Irene Sharaff</h2><p><p>This remarkable account of Irene Sharaff's star-studded career leads readers backstage and into the dressing rooms of a dazzling array of such stage and screen notables as Gypsy Rose Lee, Judy Garland, Yul Brynner, Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison, Gertrude Lawrence, Gene Kelly, Barbra Stresisand, and many others.</p> <p>Presented here are Miss Sharaff's personal and professional notes on her apprenticeship to Aline Bernstein and first steps for Broadway in the thirties and Hollywood in 1942, and on the training of eye, mind, and hand in the metier of costume designing -- from drawing board to choosing materials, from fittings to the final results.

Indeed, photography has become the family's primary means of self-representation. In <i>Family Frames</i> Marianne Hirsch uncovers both the deception and the power behind this visual record. </p><p> Hirsch provocatively explores the photographic conventions for constructing family relationships and discusses artistic strategies for challenging those constructions. When we capture our family photographically, we are often responding to an idealized image. Contemporary artists and writers, Hirsch shows, have exposed the gap between lived reality and a perceived ideal to witness contradictions that shape visual representations of parents and children, siblings, lovers, or extended families. Exploring fiction, "imagetexts," and photographic essays, she elucidates their subversive devices, giving particular attention to literal and metaphorical masks. While permitting false impressions and misreadings, family photos have also proved a powerful means for shaping personal and cultural memory. Hirsch highlights a striking example: the wide variety of family pictures surviving the Holocaust and the wrenching displacements of late-twentieth-century history. Whether personal treasures, artistic constructions, or museum installations, these images link private memory to collective history. </p></p><p><b>Marianne Hirsch</b> is Humanities Distinguished Research Professor at Dartmouth College.[Hirsch] contemplates the relationships among images, family life, memory, lost memory and memory across generations--or "postmemory" as she calls it. For her, photographs and other images are talismans, clues and building blocks of meaning. There are no innocent snapshots for her; all recording is action fraught with political and social implication. (Pat Aufderheide <i>Women's Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Marianne Hirsch's <i>Family Frames</i> offer[s] complex and useful new ways to understand our desire for and mediation of memory and history. (Martin Sturken <i>Afterimage</i>)<br><br>Marianne Hirsch's new book, <i>Family Frames</i>, looks at family photographs in literature and culture. Although its critical gaze ranges quite broadly--touching upon most of the writers, photographers, and critics who have been centrally concerned with family photography--the book begins and ends by considering family photos in relation to the Holocaust. This nonstandard frame for the subject puts both photography and the family into bold, new relief...This is not a cool, calm book, perfectly synthesizing nostalgia and critique. This is a brave, strong, struggling book, honest in letting us see an unflattering image of the critic. She combines what is seldom seen together: a feminist critique of the family as "haven in a heartless world" with a loving daughter's sensitivity to her Holocaust survivor parents' need to conserve a family threatened with radical loss.

As is often the case in dream worlds, the speaker embarks on a journey. Just where he is going remains elusive, but we do know that there is madness "in the next sleeping car" and "no release in sight." True to the unconscious mind, these poems follow their own idiosyncratic logic, as in, "It was a misunderstanding, mudsliding / from the side where the thing was let in. / And it was all goose, let me tell you, braided goose..." Ashbery deliberately roughens his edges, as if he genuinely believes, as the speaker warns in "Added Poignancy," that "millions of languages / became extinct, and not because there was nothing left to say in them, / but because it was all said too well, with / nary a dewdrop on the moment of glottal expulsion." <p> Exceptional in their daring wordplay and rhyme, teeming with the unexpected, the eccentric, and the downright freakish, these poems capture our attention by refusing to conform to narrative expectations. Here we enter the mind of an exacting genius, a mind so taken with the subtleties of language, with the way words are laid down, that when he states: "Each is truly a unique piece, / you said, or, perhaps, each / is a truly unique piece. I sniff the difference," we believe him. <i>--Martha Silano</i></p><b>John Ashbery</b> was born in Rochester, New York, in 1927 and educated at Harvard and Columbia. He is Charles P.

Curtis is an award&#x2010;winning historian, critic, curator, painter and photographer. Educated at the Courtald Institute of Art, London, and at Harvard University, he has taught the history of art, theories of design, and architecture at several universities worldwide: among others, Harvard; the Architectural Association, London; UNAM, Mexico City; ETSADB, Barcelona; Helsinki Institute of Technology; the Accadmeia, Mendrisio, Switzerland; and the University of Cambridge where he was Slade Professor of Fine Art from 2003&#x2013;4. In addition to teaching history and theory, Curtis has been directly involved in architectural education in the studio and in juries. He has written historical, critical and theoretical texts on subjects as varied as modern objects, the process of design, historiography, visual education and criticism. His best known books include: the best&#x2010;selling <i>Modern Architecture since 1900</i> (Phaidon 1982, second ed. 1987; fully revised third ed. 1996), and <i>Le Corbusier: Ideas and Forms</i> (Phaidon, 1996).</p>This thorough review of Le Corbusier (1887-1965), an inescapable force in 20th-century architecture, draws on masses of documentation now available and on a close viewing of the buildings themselves. Curtis has published several works on the architect, and this is a largely successful overview of the entire oeuvre , linking Le Corbusier's ideas and philosophy to the buildings. It is a carefully considered book, based on extensive thought and study of the vast documentation, addressed to the advanced student of modernism. Though the text at times is dense, the structure of the book is very clear and the design and layout are thoughtful and sympathetic. Highly recommended.

Unfortunately for Harry, his talent works both ways. The outer limits of horror are unleashed when Harry Keogh is recruited by the E-Branch (E for ESP) of the British Secret Service to combat his own evil counterpart, the deadly Romanian Boris Dragosani. Long buried in hallowed ground, bound by earth and silver, the master vampire schemes and plots. Trapped in unlife, neither dead nor living, Thibor Ferenczy hungers for freedom and revenge. The vampire&#39;s human tool is Boris Dragosani, part of a super-secret Soviet spy agency. Dragosani is an avid pupil, eager to plumb the depthless evil of the vampire&#39;s mind. Ferenczy teaches Dragosani the awful skills of the necromancer, gives him the ability to rip secrets from the mind and bodies of the dead. Dragosani works not for Ferenczy&#39;s freedom but is in the pay of an ultra-secret Soviet paranormal agency over which he means to gain power for himself with knowledge raped from the dead. His speciality is tearing secrets from the souls of newly dead traitors. His only opponent: Harry Koegh. Like Dragosani, Harry is a necroscope who can speak with the dead. But Harry is a champion of the dead -- and the living. From the Romanian mausoleum where the undead vampire tests the limits of his bonds, the stage is set for the most horrifying, violent supernatural confrontation ever when Harry Keogh is recruited by the British Secret Service to take on Dragosani.

Several of its wings were of modern brick upon old stone foundations, while others were of cheap breeze blocks roughly painted over in green and grey, almost as if to camouflage their ill-matching construction. Bedded at their bases in steeply gabled end walls, twin towers or minarets decayed as rotten fangs and gaunt as watchtowers--whose sagging buttresses and parapets and flaking spiral decorations detracted nothing from a sense of dereliction--raised broken bulbous domes high over the tallest trees, their boarded windows glooming like hooded eyes.The layout of the outbuildings, many of which had been recently re-roofed with modern red brick tiles, might well suggest a farm or farming community, though no crops, farm animals or machines were anywhere in evidence. The high all-encompassing perimeter wall--which from its massy structure, reinforced abutments and broad breast walls might likewise be a relic of feudal times--showed similar signs of recent repair work, where heavy grey concrete blocks had replaced crumbling stone and ancient brick. To east and west where streams ran deep and gurgling over black, rounded rocks, flowing between steep banks which formed them into natural moats, old stone bridges supporting lead roofs green with moss and age tunnelled into and through the walls, their dark mouths muzzled with steel-latticed gates. All in all grim and foreboding.As if the merest glimpse of the place from the highway would not be sufficient warning in itself, a sign at the T-junction where a cobbled track wound away from the road and into the woods declared that thisentire area was "Property of the State," patrolled and protected, and that all trespassers would be prosecuted. Motorists were not permitted to stop under any circumstances; walking in the woods was strictly forbidden; hunting and fishing likewise. Penalties would be, without exception, severe.But for all that the place seemed deserted and lost in its own miasma of desolation, as evening grew into night and a mist came up from the streams to turn the ground to milk, so lights flickered into life behind the curtained ground-floor windows, telling a different story. In the woods, on the approach roads to the covered bridges, large black saloon cars might also appear abandoned where they blocked the way--except for the dull orange glowing of hot cigarette tips within, and the smoke curling from partly wound-down windows. It was the same inside the grounds: squat, silent shapes which might just represent men, standing in the shadowed places, their dark grey overcoats as like as uniforms, faces hidden under the brims of felt hats, shoulders robotically square ... .In an inner courtyard of the main building, an ambulance--our maybe a hearse--stood with its back doors open, white-overalled attendants waiting and the driver seated uncomfortably at the high steering-wheel. One of the attendants played with a steel loading roller, spinning it on well-lubricated bearings at the rear end of the long, somehow sinister vehicle. Nearby, in an open-ended barnlike structure with a sagging canvas roof, a helicopter's dull paintwork and square glass windows gleamed darkly in shadow, its fuselage bearing the insignia of the Supreme Soviet. In one of the towers, leaning carefully on a low parapet wall, a figure with Army night-sight binoculars scanned the land about, particularly the open area between the perimeter wall and the central cluster. Projecting above his shoulder, the ugly blue metal snout of a high-calibre machine gun was limned faintly against a horizon growing steadily darker.Inside the main building, modern soundproof partition walls now divided what had once been a vast hall into fairly large rooms, serviced by a central corridor lit with a row of fluorescent tubes strung along a high ceiling. Each room had a padlocked door and all the doors were fitted with tiny grille windows with sliding covers on the inside, and with small red lights which, when blinking, signified "No Entry--Not to be Disturbed." One of these lights, halfway down the corridor on the left, was blinking even now. Leaning against the wall to one side of the door with the blinking light, a tall, hard-faced KGB operative cradled a submachine-gun in his arms. For the moment relaxed, he was ready tospring to attention--or into action--at a moment's notice. The merest hint of the door opening, the sudden cessation of the red light's blinking, and he would snap up straighter than a lamppost. For while none of the men in that room was his real master, nevertheless one of them was as powerful as anyone in the highest ranks of the KGB, perhaps one of the ten most powerful men in Russia.There were other men in the room beyond the door, which in fact was not one room but two, with an interconnecting door of their own. In the smaller room, three men sat in armchairs, smoking, their hooded eyes fixed on the partition wall, of which a large central section, floor to ceiling, was a one-way viewscreen. The floor was carpeted; a small wheeled table within easy reach supported an ashtray, glasses, and a bottle of slivovitz; all was silent except for the breathing of the three and the faint electric whirr of the air-conditioning. Subdued lighting in a false ceiling was soothing to their eyes.The man in the middle was in his mid-sixties, those to right and left perhaps fifteen years younger. His proteges, each of them knew the other for a rival. The man in the middle knew it, too. He had planned it that way. It was called survival of the fittest; only one of them would survive to take his place, when eventually that day came. By then the other would have been removed--perhaps politically, but more likely in some other, still more devious fashion. The years between would be their proving ground. Yes, survival of the fittest.Completely grey at the temples, but with a broad contrasting central stripe of jet-black hair swept back from his high, much-wrinkled brow, the senior man sipped his brandy, motioned with his cigarette. The man on his left passed the ashtray; half of the hot ash found its target, the rest fell to the floor. In a moment or two the carpet began to smoulder and a curl of acrid smoke rose up. The flanking men sat still, deliberately ignoring the burning. They knew how the older man hated fussers and fidgets. But at last their boss sniffed, glanced down at the floor from beneath bushy black eyebrows, ground his shoe into the carpet, to and fro, until the smouldering patch was extinguished.Beyond the screen, preparations of a sort had been in progress. In the Western World it might be said that a man had been "psyching himself up." His method had been simple ...startlingly simple in the light of what was about to occur; he had cleansed himself. He had stripped naked and bathed, minutely and laboriously soaping and scrubbing every square inch of his body. He had shaved himself, removing all surface hair from his person with the exception of the close-cropped hair of his head. He had defecated before and after his bath, on the secondoccasion doubly ensuring his cleanliness by washing his parts again in hot water and towelling himself dry. And then, still completely naked, he had rested.His method of resting would have seemed macabre in the extreme to anyone not in the know, but it was all part of the preparations. He had gone to sit beside the second occupant of the room where he lay upon a not quite horizontal table or trolley with a fluted aluminium surface, and had lain his head on his folded arms where he rested them upon the other's abdomen. Then he had closed his eyes and, apparently, had slept for some fifteen minutes. There was nothing erotic in it, nothing remotely homosexual. The man on the trolley was also naked, much older than the first, flabby, wrinkled, and bald but for a fringe of grey hair at his temples. He was also very dead; but even in death his pallid, puffy face, thin mouth and dense grey inward-slanting eyebrows were cruel.All of this the three on the other side of the screen had watched, and all had been accomplished with a sort of clinical detachment and no outward indication of awareness from the--performer?--that they were there at all. He had simply "forgotten" their presence; his work was all-engrossing, too important to admit of outside agencies or interferences.But now he stirred, lifted his head, blinked his eyes twice and slowly stood up. All was now in order; the inquiry could commence.The three watchers leaned forward a little in their armchairs, automatically controlled their breathing, centred all their attention on the naked man. It was as if they feared to disturb something, and this despite the fact that their observation cell was completely insulated, soundproof as a vacuum.Now the naked man turned the trolley carrying the corpse until its lower end, where the clay-cold feet projected a little way and made a "V," overhung the lip of the bath. He drew forward a second, more conventional trolley-table and opened the leather case which lay upon it, displaying scalpels, scissors, saws--a whole range of razor-sharp surgical instruments.In the observation cell, the man in the centre allowed himself a grim smile which his subordinates missed as they eased back fractionally in their chairs, satisfied now that they were about to see nothing more spectacular than a rather bizarre autopsy. Their boss could barely contain the chuckle rising from his chest, the tremor of ghoulish amusement welling in his stocky body, as he anticipated the shock they had coming to them. He had seen all of this before, but they had not. And this, too, would serve as a test of sorts.Now the naked man took up a long chromium-plated rod, needle sharp at one end and bedded in a wooden handle at the other, and without pause leaned over the corpse, placed the point of the needle in the crater of the swollen belly's navel and applied his weight to the handle. The rod slid home in dead flesh and the distended gut vented gasses accumulated in the four days since death had occurred, hissing up into the naked man's face."Audio!" snapped the observer in the middle, causing the men flanking him to start in their chairs. His gruff voice was so deep in its range as to be little more than a series of glottal gurgles as he continued: "Quickly, I want to listen!" And he waggled a stubby finger at a speaker on the wall.Gulping audibly, the man on his right stood up, stepped to the speaker, pressed a button marked "Receive." There was momentary static, then a clear <i>hiss</i> fading away as the belly of the corpse in the other room slowly settled down in folds of fat. But while yet the gas escaped, instead of drawing back, the naked man lowered his face, closed his eyes and <i>inhaled</i> deeply, filling his lungs!With his eyes glued to the one-way screen, fumbling and clumsy, the official found his chair again and seated himself heavily. His mouth, like that of his opposite number, had fallen open; both men now perched themselves on the front edges of their chairs, their backs ramrod straight, hands gripping the wooden arm rests. A cigarette, forgotten, toppled into the ashtray on the table to send up fresh streamers of perfumed smoke. Only the watcher in the middle seemed unmoved, and he was as much interested in the expressions on the faces of his subordinates as he was in the weird ritual taking place beyond the screen.The naked man had straightened up, stood erect again over the deflated corpse. He had one hand on the dead man's thigh, the other on his chest, palms flat down. His eyes were open again, round as saucers, but his colour had visibly changed. The normal, healthy pink of a young, recently scrubbed body had entirely disappeared; his grey was uniform with that of the dead flesh he touched. He was literally grey as death. He held his breath, seeming to savour the very taste of death, and his cheeks appeared to be slowly caving in. Then--He snatched back his hands from the corpse, expelled foul gas in a <i>whoosh</i>, rocked back on his heels. For a moment it seemed he must crash over backwards, but then he rocked forward again. And again, with great care, he lowered his hands to the body. Gaunt and grey as stone, he stroked the flesh, his fingers trembling as they moved with butterfly lightness from head to toe and back again. Still there wasnothing erotic in it, but the left-hand man of the trio of watchers was moved to whisper:"Is he a necrophile? What is this, Comrade General?""Be quiet and learn something," the man in the middle growled. "You know where you are, don't you? Nothing should surprise you here. As for what this is--what he is--you will see soon enough. This I will tell you: to my knowledge there are only three men like him in all the USSR. One is a Mongol from the Altai region, a tribal witch-doctor, almost dead of syphilis and useless to us. Another is hopelessly mad and scheduled for corrective lobotomy, following which he too will be ... beyond our reach. That leaves only this one and his is an instinctive art, hard to teach. Which makes him <i>sui generis.</i> That's Latin, a dead language. Most appropriate. So now shut up! You are watching a unique talent."Now, beyond the one-way window, the "unique talent" of the naked man became galvanic. As if jerked on the strings of some mad, unseen puppet-master, his burst of sudden, unexpected motion was so erratic as to be almost spastic. His right arm and hand flailed towards his case of instruments, almost tumbling it from its table. His hand, shaped by his spasm into a grey claw, swept aloft as if conducting some esoteric concerto--but instead of a baton it held a glittering, crescent-shaped scalpel.All three observers were now craning forward, eyes huge and mouths agape; but while the faces of the two on the outside were fixed in a sort of involuntary rictus of denial--prepared to wince or even exclaim at what they now suspected was to come--that of their superior was shaped only of knowledge and morbid expectancy.With a precision denying the seemingly eccentric or at best random movements of the rest of his limbs--which now fluttered and twitched like those of a dead frog, electrically coerced into a pseudo-life of their own--the arm and hand of the naked man swept down and sliced open the corpse from just below the ribcage, through the navel and down to the mass of wiry grey pubic hair. Two more apparently random but absolutely <i>exact</i> slashes, following so rapidly as almost to be a part of the first movement, and the cadaver's belly was marked with a great "I" with extended top and bottom bars.Without pause, the hideously automatic author of this awful surgery now blindly tossed away his blade across the room, dug his hands into the central incision up to his wrists and laid back the flaps of the dead man's abdomen like a pair of cupboard doors. Cold, the exposed guts did not smoke; no blood flowed as such; but when the naked man took away his hands they glistened a dull red, as if fresh painted.To perform this opening of the body had required an effort of almost ...</p><h2>The Book of Lost Tales, Part One (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 1)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.</p><p>&#39;For the true devotee of Tolkien &#39;The Book of Lost Tales&#39; is a treasure trove to match the hoard of the dragon Smaug himself.

Few figures in American history are more controversial than Alexander Hamilton. In this masterful work, Chernow shows how the political and economic power of America today is the result of Hamilton&#39;s willingness to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. He charts his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Monroe and Burr; his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds; his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza; and the notorious duel with Aaron Burr that led to his death in July 1804. This book was adapted into a hugely successful Broadway musical - nominated for a record 16 Tony awards and winner of 11 - opens at the Victoria Palace Theatre in November 2017.</p><p>Building on biographies by <i>Richard Brookhiser</i> and <i>Willard Sterne Randall</i>, Ron Chernow&#x2019;s <i>Alexander Hamilton</i> provides what may be the most comprehensive modern examination of the often overlooked Founding Father. From the start, Chernow argues that Hamilton&#x2019;s premature death at age 49 left his record to be reinterpreted and even re-written by his more long-lived enemies, among them: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Monroe. Hamilton&#x2019;s achievements as first Secretary of the Treasury, co-author of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, and member of the Constitutional Convention were clouded after his death by strident claims that he was an arrogant, self-serving monarchist. Chernow delves into the almost 22,000 pages of letters, manuscripts, and articles that make up Hamilton&#x2019;s legacy to reveal a man with a sophisticated intellect, a romantic spirit, and a late-blooming religiosity.<p> One fault of the book, is that Chernow is so convinced of Hamilton&#x2019;s excellence that his narrative sometimes becomes hagiographic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Chernow&#x2019;s account of the infamous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. He describes Hamilton&#x2019;s final hours as pious, while Burr, Jefferson, and Adams achieve an almost cartoonish villainy at the news of Hamilton&#x2019;s passing. </p><p> A defender of the union against New England secession and an opponent of slavery, Hamilton has a special appeal to modern sensibilities. Chernow argues that in contrast to Jefferson and Washington&#x2019;s now outmoded agrarian idealism, Hamilton was "the prophet of the capitalist revolution" and the true forebear of modern America. In his Prologue, he writes: "In all probability, Alexander Hamilton is the foremost figure in American history who never attained the presidency, yet he probably had a much deeper and more lasting impact than many who did." With <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>, this impact can now be more widely appreciated. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Ron Chernow is the Pulitzer prize-winning author of Washington: A Life (2011).

But ten years have passed, and no girls have come forward. Now, however, someone is about to change all that. Her name is Kel. In this first book in a new series from popular children&#39;s fantasy writer Tamora Pierce, we are introduced to a strong, adventurous new heroine who will win the hearts and minds of fantasy fans.In the sixth grade, Tamora Pierce was encouraged by her father to start writing and she immediately got hooked. Once she discovered fantasy and science fiction, she tried to write the same kind of stories she read, only with teenaged girl heroines who were usually missing from the 1960s stories. <br><br>Before her junior year at the University of Pennsylvania where she studied psychology, Pierce rediscovered writing when she wrote her first original short story since tenth grade. She sold her first story a year later and then enrolled in a fiction writing course during her senior year. When her teacher suggested that she tackle a novel, her childhood ideas came back to her and she began her first sword and sorcery novel. <br><br>Pierce then worked as a housemother in an Idaho group home for teenaged girls, who loved hearing Alanna&#x2019;s story from the in-progress quartet, Song of the Lioness.

More than her famous father,&nbsp;<i>Maus</i>&nbsp;creator Art Spiegelman, and even more than most mothers, hers&#x2014;French-born&nbsp;<i>New Yorker</i>&nbsp;art director Fran�oise Mouly&#x2014;exerted a force over reality that was both dazzling and daunting. As Nadja&#x2019;s body changed and &#x201c;began to whisper to the adults around me in a language I did not understand,&#x201d; their relationship grew tense. Unwittingly, they were replaying a drama from her mother&#x2019;s past, a drama Nadja sensed but had never been told. Then, after college, her mother suddenly opened up to her. Fran�oise recounted her turbulent adolescence caught between a volatile mother and a playboy father, one of the first&nbsp;plastic surgeons in France. The weight of the difficult stories she told her daughter shifted the balance between them.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had taken an ocean to allow Fran�oise the distance to become her own person.

Nadja emerged with a deeper understanding of how each generation reshapes the past in order to forge ahead, their narratives both weapon and defense, eternally in conflict. Every reader will recognize herself and her family in <i>I'm Supposed to Protect You From All This, </i>a&nbsp;gorgeous and heartbreaking memoir that helps us to see why sometimes those who love us best hurt us most.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2016:</strong> Nadja Spiegelman--daughter of <em>Maus</em> creator Art Spiegelman and <em>New Yorker</em> art editor Fran�oise Mouly--is no different from many daughters out there who have fraught relationships with their mothers. But not many mothers would agree to do what the Mouly matriarchs did&#x2014;be interviewed for a book about their lives, a project Nadja hoped would answer some painful questions, and begin to bridge the emotional divides between them. The result is the poignant <em>I&#x2019;m Supposed to Protect You from All This</em>, not just a memoir about mothers and daughters (and grandmothers), but a story about stories and the malleability of memory. Spiegelman discovers that both her mother&#x2019;s and grandmother&#x2019;s accounts of the same events were often vastly (and heartbreakingly) different, yet neither was being more or less genuine. We interpret memories through the lens of our emotional state and experiences, and over the years we overwrite certain details&#x2014;adding color here, omitting something there&#x2014;creating telling palimpsests that help explain who we are and why we do what we do. Spiegelman is a skilled writer, especially considering the thorny material. Moreover, you get a sense that she accomplished what she set out to do. In a larger context, it also serves as a valuable reminder to try and understand the motivation behind other people&#x2019;s actions, not to mention our own. As this memoir attests, therein lies forgiveness, and the fortitude to forge ahead. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Nadja Spiegelman</b> grew up in New York City and now divides her time between Paris and Brooklyn.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Look Now and Other Stories</h2><p>The title novella of this collection features John and Laura who are on holiday in Venice.

She lives in the Midwest with her husband and two sons.</p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br>The last day of December, and the sky was going dark fast. Landon Guthrie ran his tongue around his teeth, tasting stale peanuts and bitter chocolate, the remnants of the energy bar. Pushing up the cuff of his glove, he checked his watch. The puff of breath that followed was a silent curse. In less than an hour, the season would be over and he had yet to get his buck.<br><br>His compound bow lay across his lap with the arrow nocked. He sat fifteen feet off the ground in his deer stand, looking down at a clearing. No fewer than three deer trails spilled into the circle of dead grass and fallen leaves. Less than half a mile behind him was a slushy stream, the animals' drive-thru window for drinks.<br><br>The temperature had been dropping all day, but Guthrie was dressed for it--a walking testament to the power of synthetics: Polar fleece. Thinsulate. Polypropylene. Nylon. Acrylic. Vinyl. He was windproof, water-repellent, slip-resistant, and warm.<br><br>Everything had been doused with scent blocker and all the outer layers were in a Mossy Oak fall camo of branches and brown leaves. He didn't need the winter camo, which had branches against a white background, because the snow had yet to fly in northern Minnesota.<br><br>Glancing up at the sky, Guthrie wondered if they'd finally get snow that night. If not a white Christmas, they could at least enjoy a white New Year's Day. A hawk glided overhead in search of something to eat, and he wished the bird better luck than he'd had. Time to start packing it in. He stood up on the platform and stretched, the bow still in his hand.<br><br>A rustling across the clearing froze him. A buck stepped out from between the trees. As the metallic taste of adrenaline bit the back of his throat, Guthrie willed himself to stay calm. He told himself not to look at the rack; it would only make him more nervous. Ignoring his own directive, he counted. Ten points. Good enough.<br><br>Fifty yards from the stand, the buck paused, surveying the clearing. Ran on. Thirty yards. Twenty. It stalled again; something had spooked it. The buck took a ninety-degree turn to the right. Guthrie released the arrow, and the broadhead went in just behind the rib cage.<br><br>The buck sprinted from the clearing, seeking refuge amid the trees. Guthrie got out of his safety harness and took his time climbing down from the stand. Chasing the wounded deer immediately would make the animal run too hard, and increase the possibility of losing it. Better to give it a chance to lie down.<br><br>After strapping a headlamp on over his cap, Guthrie hiked into the thick woods behind the stand to track his prize. His breath hung in the air as he threaded between the trees. He was halfway between the clearing and the stream when he lost the blood trail in the growing darkness. The ground beneath his feet was as hard as concrete, and dry as dust. He wished there had been snow on the ground; it would have made the tracking easier. He stayed on a straight path, heading for the stream. Instinct told him that was where he needed to go.<br><br>At the edge of the water, Guthrie found her. "Jesus!"<br><br>Guthrie stumbled backward, pulled his right glove off with his teeth, and fumbled around his clothing. Damn jacket had too many pockets. His fingertips finally touched the square edges of the cell and he pulled it out. He knew from experience that he couldn't get a signal where he was standing, but he tried anyway. Hands shaking, he pressed the green button and eyed the screen, praying for bars. Nothing.<br><br>Phone still in his hand, he took a step forward. His headlamp illuminated the body and the area around it with a round, soft glow. Snow drifted down from the night sky, sparkling in the lamp's beam like shards of glass. Flakes disappeared against her nightgown and melted into the red staining the fabric. He looked down at the phone and repeatedly pressed the green button, hoping for a miracle. Still no bars. He shoved the cell in his pocket.<br><br>He turned his back to the body, leaned a hand against a tree, and vomited peanuts and chocolate. As he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, he eyed the forest with fresh fear. Since he was a child, the woods had been his second home. He knew every ridge and ravine, every clearing, every hollow. Every marsh and slough. He was familiar with where the deer liked to hang out during deep snows and where they went during droughts. He could correctly identify the different hardwoods and pines. He could pick out the chatter of a gray squirrel and describe how it was different from the racket made by a red squirrel.<br><br>Now a monster had invaded his home.<br><br>He ran away from the stream, diving back into the trees. He aimed for his stand. North of that would be the road, and his truck. As he pumped his legs, his heart pounded hard in his chest and the cold night air burned his throat.<br><br>All that blood. That thing on her face. Who'd done that? What did it mean?<br><br>No, he told himself. North. Worry about heading north and stop thinking about what was by the water.<br><br>What he'd seen by the stream was a girl sprawled on her back in a blood-soaked nightgown.<br><br>On her forehead, a five-pointed star drawn in red.<br><b>CHAPTER TWO</b><br>Who'd be calling first thing in the morning on New Year's Day? Instead of reaching for the phone, Bernadette Saint Clare pulled a pillow down over the back of her head.<br><br>"Is that your work cell, Bern?"<br><br>With both hands, she pressed the pillow tighter and wished her guest and the ringing would go away.<br><br>"I think that's the bureau calling, Bern."<br><br>The ringing stopped. One wish granted.<br><br>She could hear him stomping around the bedroom and fumbling with her phone. "Garcia. Shit. He'll call back if it was important, right? Want me to make you something? Got eggs?"<br><br>"No," she said into the mattress.<br><br>She'd had a little too much to drink at an unofficial bureau bash and had asked one of the tech guys to drive her home. He'd spent the night on the couch.<br><br>A tech guy!<br><br>She heard more stomping around the bedroom. This guy was enormous.<br><br>"I left some Tylenol and water by the bed, Bern."<br><br>She sat up, hugging the pillow to her front. To make matters worse, it was B.K., the most junior guy on TSS, the Technical Support Squad. They'd been nicknamed the Tough Shit Squad because that's what they said when turning down the other agents' many requests for their help. Admittedly, he'd helped her out last night. "Thank you for the ride," she said, running a hand through her short blond hair. Her forehead felt ready to explode, and her mouth tasted like the inside of an old tennis shoe.<br><br>He sat down on the edge of the bed and folded his long arms in front of him. In his white T-shirt and jeans, he looked like a supersized toddler. "Breakfast?"<br><br>She curled her legs up to her chest and struggled to remember his real name. Everyone called him B.K., which stood for Big Kid. She scooped up the Tylenol and downed it with a hit of water. "This is all I want this morning, B.K."<br><br>He got up off the mattress. "Everybody at the soiree sure had a good time."<br><br>The soiree. A kegger held in somebody's basement rec room. She hardly knew most of the other partiers, agents stationed in downtown Minneapolis. She worked solo out of downtown St. Paul. Assistant Special Agent in Charge Anthony Garcia was her only regular visitor and an occasional partner. He'd been at the party but had kept his distance. That had ticked her off, and caused her to down a few too many. She looked up at the kid and wished like hell she could ask: Did Garcia see us leave together? Instead, she smiled weakly and said nothing, waiting for him to leave.<br><br>He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. "So... "<br><br>"So... "<br><br>He rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet. "I guess I could go home and feed my cats."<br><br>"I guess you could," she said, wondering why he was stalling. Did he expect a more elaborate expression of gratitude? He wasn't going to get it.<br><br>"Uh... you have to give me a ride to my car. I drove your truck, remember?"<br><br>She felt her face heat up. "Be down in a sec."<br><br>"I'll get some coffee going."<br><br>"Good idea." As she watched B.K. heading for the stairs, she felt guilty that she'd harbored nasty thoughts about him. She should make him breakfast.<br><br>Her cell rang again, and she picked up. "Yeah."<br><br>Garcia: "You sound like shit."<br><br>As if he could see her through the phone, she hugged the pillow tighter to her chest. "I'm fine. Sleepy."<br><br>"Wake up fast, because I've got a bad one, Cat," said her boss, calling her by her nickname. "Really need you on it. It's all...&nbsp; political and messy."<br><br>She leaned back against the headboard. "Tell me."<br><br>"A teenage runaway was found dead in Paul Bunyan State Forest last night. Bow hunter came across the body while tracking a deer. She was... sliced up."<br><br>"Stabbed to death?"<br><br>"Back of the head bashed in." Garcia cleared his throat. "Let me back up. This girl was pregnant and the baby was... removed after the mother died."<br><br>"That's sick. That is just fucking sick. So they found the dead fetus near the--"<br><br>"The fetus is missing."<br><br>Bernadette sat upright in bed. "Someone killed her, cut her open, and stole her baby?"<br><br>"Yeah."<br><br>"Did it survive? Did the baby survive?"<br><br>"A big question mark," said Garcia.<br><br>"They took it, so it has to be alive," she said. "Otherwise, why bother?"<br><br>"Maybe they started out wanting a live baby, but who knows what they ended up with? This was a very brutal, slipshod job. Vertical slice right through the navel."<br><br>She switched the phone to her other ear. "There've been other stolen-fetus cases."<br><br>"There's more. There was a five-pointed star--"<br><br>"A pentagram?"<br><br>"Yeah. There was a pentagram drawn on her forehead, apparently in her own blood."<br><br>Bernadette had worked on some ritualistic slaying cases for the bureau. "A cult thing?"<br><br>"I don't know what we're thinking," Garcia said.<br><br>"How's this a bureau case?"<br><br>"It's because of the victim's father," said Garcia. "That's where politics come into play."<br><br>"I'm listening."<br><br>"Dead kid was Mag Dunton's daughter."<br><br>"Crap," she said.<br><br>United States Senator Magnus Dunton, an independent from Minnesota, was not a friend of the FBI. While a chorus had accused the bureau of abusing civil liberties via the Patriot Act, Dunton's voice had been the loudest. Not content to call for tougher limits on antiterrorism laws, the senator had come up with a scheme to dismantle the FBI and divide its duties among other agencies. Though his outrageous plan wasn't being taken seriously on Capitol Hill, he'd opened up a discussion regarding the bureau's functions and its budget. Suddenly there were proposals being floated to close several FBI field offices.<br><br>"I suppose Dunton doesn't want us anywhere near the case," she said.<br><br>"His people won't return my messages, but I think that's a safe assumption."<br><br>"Why not let the BCA take care of it?" she asked, referring to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a state criminal-investigation agency.<br><br>"The BCA thought it was taking care of it, partnering with the locals. The sheriff up there, Seth Wharten, he's a fishing buddy of mine. His people are the best. But it's not my call. Headquarters handed me my marching orders this morning. Minneapolis Division is to take point on this thing. We're treating it as a kidnapping."<br><br>"Did they ask for me specifically?"<br><br>Garcia sighed. "What do you want me to say, Cat? They asked for you without asking for you."<br><br>"I know how it works." Bernadette rubbed the sleep from her eyes. "Pentagram, huh? This could be interesting."<br><br>"Loads of fun."<br><br>"I'm sorry the man lost his daughter," she said quickly. "What was her name?"<br><br>"Lydia."<br><br>"What was she doing way in the hell up north?"<br><br>"Good question."<br><br>"I've got about one million others."<br><br>"We can talk on the road," he said. "Pack enough clothes to last awhile, including some serious outdoor gear. My cousin's got a cabin on the Crow Wing chain of lakes and he said we could crash there."<br><br>We. Quite a change from the night before. A couple of months earlier, they'd come close to hopping in the sack together. They avoided talking about it now, acting as if it had never happened. Maybe that was why he was behaving inconsistently. Still, she wasn't going to be the one to break the code of silence on the subject. Bernadette smelled coffee and heard her guest clomping around downstairs. Getting B.K. to his car was going to take time. "I have to pull myself together," she said.<br><br>"I'll pick you up in an hour. We're going to have to drive. Nothing can fly in this stuff."<br><br>She looked out a window across from the bed. The snow was coming down thick. "I'll be ready to rumble," she said, kicking off the covers.<br><br>"Let's hope like hell your hands and eyes feel the same way."</p><h2>Choosing &amp; Raising Chickens: The Complete Guide to Breeds and Welfare</h2><p>A practical and comprehensive everything-you-need-to-know guide to chicken breeds for anyone who keeps or is aspiring to keep chickens.

Students also learn how to attack each type of multiple-choice question metacognitively through our unique �E-R-A� approach� in which students examine the question, recall what they know and apply what they know to select the best answer. Each of the TEKS is completely covered. Information is organized logically around social studies skills and methods, and a chronological approach incorporating history, geography, economics, and government. Each Unit Opener serves as an advance organizer. There is also a word wall with the most important terms and concepts found in the unit. Applying What You Have Learned and Amateur Historian sections stimulate students to think about and apply what they have just learned. Study Cards are found at the end of each content chapter. Each chapter is followed by a Checking Your Understanding feature with both guided and independent practice. These questions are designed to mirror those questions students will find on the actual End-of-Course Test. Each unit concludes with a Concept Map, helping students to visually organize and review each standard and to see various relationships more clearly. A Complete Final Practice Test has the same distribution of questions and level of difficulty as the actual End-of-Course Test.

Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. <p> Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys had been so mean and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<p>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girls' bathroom. But then the real trouble begins -- someone is turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself!</p></p><h2>Before Lewis and Clark: Documents Illustrating the History of the Missouri, 1785-1804: 001</h2><p>Historical text showing the creation and growth of Missouri.</p><p></p><h2>Bonanza Girl</h2><p>New 100% of proceeds from this Fundraiser provides free clothing and toys to foster and displaced children through Foster Care Support Foundation</p><p></p><h2>Ohio: Geography, History, Government</h2><p>Basically a history of Ohio, but with material on the state&#39;s government, culture, and famous people.</p><p></p><h2>Big Book of Cello Songs (Big Book (Hal Leonard))</h2><p>(Instrumental Folio).

In 1950, publisher Fawcett Books founded its Gold Medal imprint, inaugurating the reign of lesbian pulp fiction. These were the books that small-town lesbians and prurient men bought by the millions &#x2014; cheap, easy to find in drugstores, and immediately recognizable by their lurid covers. For women leading straight lives, here was confirmation that they were not alone and that darkly glamorous, "gay" places like Greenwich Village existed. Some &#x2014; especially those written by lesbians &#x2014; offered sympathetic and realistic depictions of "life in the shadows," while others (no less fun to read now) were smutty, sensational tales of innocent girls led astray. In the overheated prose typical of the genre, this collection documents the emergence of a lesbian subculture in postwar America.</p><p>Katherine V.

But, of course, the dog never tasted her mouth-watering pound cake....Wise witty, down-home and real, WALKING ACROSS EGYPT is a book for everyone.</p><p>Clyde Edgerton lives in Apex, North Carolina. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and now teaches at St. Andrew&#39;s College, Laurinburg.YA A quietly humorous story set in a small town in North Carolina. Seventy-eight year old Mattie Riggsbee, spunky and determined, has one regret: she has no grandchildren, as her son and daughter inconveniently remain unmarried. The story gathers momentum after a slightly sluggish start, when Wesley Benfield, wayward teenager and orphan, comes into Mattie's life. Their need for each other is apparent, and their attempts to get together, despite the disapproval of Mattie's family and neighbors, are the focus of the story. Wesley is captivated by Mattie's good cooking and grandmotherly attention, and when he escapes from a house of detention, he heads straight to Mattie. There is a hilarious scene in church, where the fleeing Wesley and the pursuing deputy sheriff, both disguised as choir members, sit beside each other in full view of the congregation. Edgerton infuses all of his characters with reality, and provides a balanced perspective on age and youth. His understanding of teenagers is nowhere more evident than in the contrast between the reality of Wesley's situation and the humor of his exaggerated fantasies. Rita G.

This provocative rewarding study starts with that architectural premise, then goes on to consider individual Impressionists in the context of the social forces that shaped their art. Renoir, a working-class boy who climbed out of poverty by aspiring to a life of ease, conjured up a fleshy Arcadia that reflected city-dwellers' longing for social harmony; his sin, according to Yale art-history professor Herbert, was self-delusion. Degas infused painting with caricature, unmasking upper-class hypocrisy. Picture after picture is given a fresh, often unexpected reading, and the 320 plates (two-thirds in color) are deftly interwoven with the sprightly narrative. The study is a visual and intellectual feast. BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Herbert's revisionist approach to Impressionism shows how the transformation of the Parisian life-style during the third quarter of the 19th century influenced the style and, more importantly, the subjects of Impressionist painters. As broad, tree-lined boulevards and large parks filled the city with air and light, leisure became a prime concern. The various forms of entertainment that developedcafes-concerts, ballet, horseracing, picnicking, boatingconsequently became the focus of Impressionist paintings.

Bedouin women were expected to master the art of making entire tents as well as a wide range of rugs, saddlebags and other equipment able to withstand the rigours of the desert. They took a fierce pride in their work and produced, on the simplest ground looms, textiles that were at once hard-wearing and of vibrant aesthetic appeal. The true craftspeople of the desert, Bedouin women wove to provide the very fabric of day-to-day living. Joy Hilden describes the weaving techniques of the Bedouin in the context of their transitional mode of life, as they adapt from their centuries-old nomadic existence to being both semi- and fully settled. She gathered her information on dyeing, spinning and weaving while living and travelling in Saudi Arabia between 1982 and 1994, extending her scope with trips to other parts of the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent Arab countries. She describes visits to Bedouin families, desert markets and urban centres where Bedouin gathered. Her work comes at a time when many tribal peoples are losing their cultural traditions and, with them, their crafts and the material of everyday life in the desert. This is the most exhaustive study to date of the weaving methods practised by the Bedouin of Saudi Arabia. Profusely illustrated, and giving thorough instruction in techniques, Bedouin Weaving is an essential companion for collectors and connoisseurs of flat-weave textiles, the category into which Bedouin weavings fall. It is aimed both at general readers and at weavers, craftspeople in general, students, ethnographers, and museum and textile authorities.</p><p>Joy Totah Hilden, an acknowledged authority on Bedouin textiles, brings to this work her background as a teacher of art and English. Born in Jerusalem in 1935 to a Palestinian father and American mother, she spent her childhood in Palestine, where she observed many crafts in action, including Bedouin weaving. Subsequently, she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree from the San Francisco Art Institute, and later earned Secondary Teaching Credentials in art and English.<br><br>She took her interest in textiles with her to Saudi Arabia, where her husband taught English at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran. Her experience with Arabic enabled her to communicate with Bedouin women about their dyeing, spinning and weaving, while her academic background proved useful with the writing, drawing and photography involved in the field research.<br><br>Her website (www.beduinweaving.com) includes text and photographs of articles and academic papers she has written. Joy Hilden now lives in California.This is a book that satisfies on so many levels whether your interest is in the Arabian Peninsulas history, geography, tribes, culture or textiles.

Ali ties the mysterious disappearance of two young girls to the rape and murder long ago of Susan Kendall, the twin sister of a small-town New York policeman, Rouge. Realizing that the priest who was convicted of Susan Kendall's murder is probably innocent, Rouge has a personal as well as professional reason for joining Ali in tracking down Susan's killer before he completes the ritual murder of at least one of the missing girls.<p> The protagonists of <i>Judas Child</i> are direct literary descendants of Mallory, the author's earlier creation; like her, their childhood suffering illuminates their adult character and motivation. But while Mallory can only react to the past, Rouge and Ali find in each other a mirror that lights up the dark corners of their past and frees them of the survivor guilt both suffer. O'Connell's same penetrating psychological insight animates the novel's other characters: Dr. Mortimer Cray, Ali's uncle, a psychiatrist who bears the awful burden of knowing who the killer is but is constrained by professional ethics from revealing it; gutsy, clever Sadie Green, the Judas child of the title, and her irritating, annoying, desperate mother, Becca; FBI agent Arnie Pyle, who's dying to know how Ali got her scar; and Father Paul Marie, jailed for 15 years for a crime he may not have committed. The opening sentence grabs the reader, and doesn't let go till the last page. In her skilled rendering of psychological suspense, O'Connell is on a par with Barbara Vine and Frances Fyfield; like Jonathan Kellerman, she is also an astute observer of children, especially those who survive the most terrifying youthful traumas and betrayals. Judas Child may be O'Connell's "breakout" book, and it will surely send readers who've just discovered her in search of her backlist while they await her next one. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Instantly reduce the number of seams to sew, using fast fusible interfacing and as few as three fabrics. This all-new technique speeds up construction and creates beautiful watercolor-style quilts in a snap. Now beginning and advanced quilters can all join the watercolor craze! Learn how to:<br><br> * Create 13 gorgeous watercolor quilts featuring wreaths, hearts, baskets, and other motifs <br><br> * Stitch 85% fewer seams than traditional watercolor quilts require <br><br> * Align seams perfectly without expert rotary-cutting skills (the interfacing forgives inaccurate cutting!)</p><p>The lovely painterly effect of watercolor quilts appeals to many quilters, but the technique is generally quite labor-intensive and time-consuming. Dina Pappas has refined a method that greatly simplifies the process, and her book explains it all clearly. Her secret is gridded fusible interfacing (bought with a printed grid or penciled on), on which the fabric squares are laid out and fused on; the whole piece is then folded on the grid lines and stitched. Not only does this greatly simplify and speed up the procedure, but it also allows for easy rearrangement of the layout before fusing; it also prevents quilters from accidentally rotating or mixing up the squares when stitching them together. The other element that makes this approach so easy entails keeping the designs fairly simple and small, though the technique can certainly be adapted to larger, more complex designs as quilters become more comfortable with the system. Pappas includes a good general overview of quilting basics, and the 13 step-by-step projects let newcomers practice the method under her tutelage before branching out on their own. <i>--Amy Handy</i>Dina Pappas sewed as a girl, but it wasn't until she was engaged to her soon-to-be husband that she made her first quilt.

The author of this book discusses the history and techniques of soda glazing, giving plans of kilns and detailed notes on how to produce this attractive effect. She compares its similarities to and differences from salt glazing. As air pollution causes increasing concern, and as governments legislate accordingly, soda glazing is likely to be used as a more welcome alternative to salt glazing. The work of an international group of ceramic artists is used to illustrate the text.&#34;</p><p>Soda glazing was, for many years, the neglected cousin of salt glazing. However, as pollution laws have become stricter, more potters have turned to soda and, to their delight, found not only the traditional orange peel surface but also a subtle palette of colours which have made them sit up and take notice. In this book, Ruthanne Tudball discusses the history of and techniques involved in soda glazing. She includes body and slip recipes, kiln designs and firing methods specifically developed for soda glazing and she illustrates her text with the work of an international group of artists.Ruthanne Tudball is a well-known potter, teacher, and lecturer.

Much of what makes civilization had already existed for thousands of years in Egypt and in Mesopotamia, and had spread thence to neighbouring countries. But certain elements had been lacking until the Greeks supplied them. What they achieved in art and literature is familiar to everybody, but what they did in the purely intellectual realm is even more exceptional. They invented mathematics and science and philosophy; they first wrote history as opposed to mere annals; they speculated freely about the nature of the world and the ends of life, without being bound in the fetters of any inherited orthodoxy. What occurred was so astonishing that, until very recent times, men were content to gape and talk mystically about the Greek genius. It is possible, however, to understand the development of Greece in scientific terms, and it is well worth while to do so. </p><p> Philosophy begins with Thales, who, fortunately, can be dated by the fact that he predicted an eclipse which, according to the astronomers, occurred in the year 585 B.C. Philosophy and science -- which were not originally separate -- were therefore born together at the beginning of the sixth century. What had been happening in Greece and neighbouring countries before this time? Any answer must be in part conjectural, but archeology, during the present century, has given us much more knowledge than was possessed by our grandfathers. </p><p> The art of writing was invented in Egypt about the year 4000 B.C., and in Babylonia not much later. In each country writing began with pictures of the objects intended. These pictures quickly became conventionalized, so that words were represented by ideograms, as they still are in China. In the course of thousands of years, this cumbrous system developed into alphabetic writing. </p><p> The early development of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia was due to the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, which made agriculture very easy and very productive. The civilization was in many ways similar to that which the Spaniards found in Mexico and Peru. There was a divine king, with despotic powers; in Egypt, he owned all the land. There was a polytheistic religion, with a supreme god to whom the king had a specially intimate relation. There was a military aristocracy, and also a priestly aristocracy. The latter was often able to encroach on the royal power, if the king was weak or if he was engaged in a difficult war. The cultivators of the soil were serfs, belonging to the king, the aristocracy, or the priesthood. </p><p> There was a considerable difference between Egyptian and Babylonian theology. The Egyptians were preoccupied with death, and believed that the souls of the dead descend into the underworld, where they are judged by Osiris according to the manner of their life on earth. They thought that the soul would ultimately return to the body; this led to mummification and to the construction of splendid tombs. The pyramids were built by various kings at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. and the beginning of the third. After this time, Egyptian civilization became more and more stereotyped, and religious conservatism made progress impossible. About 1800 B.C. Egypt was conquered by Semites named Hyksos, who ruled the country for about two centuries. They left no permanent mark on Egypt, but their presence there must have helped to spread Egyptian civilization in Syria and Palestine. </p><p> Babylonia had a more warlike development than Egypt. At first, the ruling race were not Semites, but "Sumerians," whose origin is unknown. They invented cuneiform writing, which the conquering Semites took over from them. There was a period when there were various independent cities which fought with each other, but in the end Babylon became supreme and established an empire. The gods of other cities became subordinate, and Marduk, the god of Babylon, acquired a position like that later held by Zeus in the Greek pantheon. The same sort of thing had happened in Egypt, but at a much earlier time. </p><p> The religions of Egypt and Babylonia, like other ancient religions, were originally fertility cults. The earth was female, the sun male. The bull was usually regarded as an embodiment of male fertility, and bull-gods were common. In Babylon, Ishtar, the earth-goddess, was supreme among female divinities. Throughout western Asia, the Great Mother was worshipped under various names. When Greek colonists in Asia Minor found temples to her, they named her Artemis and took over the existing cult. This is the origin of "Diana of the Ephesians." Christianity transformed her into the Virgin Mary, and it was a Council at Ephesus that legitimated the title "Mother of God" as applied to Our Lady. </p><p> Where a religion was bound up with the government of an empire, political motives did much to transform its primitive features. A god or goddess became associated with the State, and had to give, not only an abundant harvest, but victory in war. A rich priestly caste elaborated the ritual and the theology, and fitted together into a pantheon the several divinities of the component parts of the empire. </p><p> Through association with government, the gods also became associated with morality. Lawgivers received their codes from a god; thus a breach of the law became an impiety. The oldest legal code still known is that of Hammurabi, king of Babylon, about 2100 B.C.; this code was asserted by the king to have been delivered to him by Marduk. The connection between religion and morality became continually closer throughout ancient times. </p><p> Babylonian religion, unlike that of Egypt, was more concerned with prosperity in this world than with happiness in the next. Magic, divination, and astrology, though not peculiar to Babylonia, were more developed there than elsewhere, and it was chiefly through Babylon that they acquired their hold on later antiquity. From Babylon come some things that belong to science: the division of the day into twenty-four hours, and of the circle into 360 degrees; also the discovery of a cycle in eclipses, which enabled lunar eclipses to be predicted with certainty, and solar eclipses with some probability. This Babylonian knowledge, as we shall see, was acquired by Thales. </p><p> The civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia were agricultural, and those of surrounding nations, at first, were pastoral. A new element came with the development of commerce, which was at first almost entirely maritime. Weapons, until about 1000 B.C., were made of bronze, and nations which did not have the necessary metals on their own territory were obliged to obtain them by trade or piracy. Piracy was a temporary expedient, and where social and political conditions were fairly stable, commerce was found to be more profitable. In commerce, the island of Crete seems to have been the pioneer. For about eleven centuries, say from 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C., an artistically advanced culture, called the Minoan, existed in Crete. What survives of Cretan art gives an impression of cheerfulness and almost decadent luxury, very different from the terrifying gloom of Egyptian temples. </p><p> Of this important civilization almost nothing was known until the excavations of Sir Arthur Evans and others. It was a maritime civilization, in close touch with Egypt (except during the time of the Hyksos). From Egyptian pictures it is evident that the very considerable commerce between Egypt and Crete was carried on by Cretan sailors; this commerce reached its maximum about 1500 B.C. The Cretan religion appears to have had many affinities with the religions of Syria and Asia Minor, but in art there was more affinity with Egypt, though Cretan art was very original and amazingly full of life. The centre of the Cretan civilization was the so-called "palace of Minos" at Knossos, of which memories lingered in the traditions of classical Greece. The palaces of Crete were very magnificent, but were destroyed about the end of the fourteenth century B.C., probably by invaders from Greece. The chronology of Cretan history is derived from Egyptian objects found in Crete, and Cretan objects found in Egypt; throughout, our knowledge is dependent on archeological evidence. </p><p> The Cretans worshipped a goddess, or perhaps several goddesses. The most indubitable goddess was the "Mistress of Animals," who was a huntress, and probably the source of the classical Artemis. She or another was also a mother; the only male deity, apart from the "Master of Animals," is her young son. There is some evidence of belief in an after life, in which, as in Egyptian belief, deeds on earth receive reward or retribution. But on the whole the Cretans appear, from their art, to have been cheerful people, not much oppressed by gloomy superstitions. They were fond of bull-fights, at which female as well as male toreadors performed amazing acrobatic feats. The bull-fights were religious celebrations, and Sir Arthur Evans thinks that the performers belonged to the highest nobility. The surviving pictures are full of movement and realism. </p><p> The Cretans had a linear script, but it has not been deciphered. At home they were peaceful, and their cities were unwalled; no doubt they were defended by sea power. </p><p> Before the destruction of the Minoan culture, it spread, about 1600 B.C., to the mainland of Greece, where it survived, through gradual stages of degeneration, until about 900 B.C. This mainland civilization is called the Mycenaean; it is known through the tombs of kings, and also through fortresses on hill- tops, which show more fear of war than had existed in Crete. Both tombs and fortresses remained to impress the imagination of classical Greece. The older art products in the palaces are either actually of Cretan workmanship, or closely akin to those of Crete. The Mycenaean civilization, seen through a haze of legend, is that which is depicted in Homer. </p><p> There is much uncertainty concerning the Mycenaeans. Did they owe their civilization to being conquered by the ...</p></p><h2>Holy Bible (King James Version)</h2><p><p>This quality ministry and pew Bible in the King James Version is priced right for use by churches, church schools, institutions, or outreach ministries.

Muriel, for her part, seemed pleased. She sat with her legs splayed and her arms around herself, as if reliving the event. Her face wore an expression of daft beatitude.</p><p>It was always hard to know what would please Muriel. That winter, when the old man fell on the street and broke his hip, Muriel had personally split her sides. She was in her way a formidable character. It wasn't often she had a good laugh.</p><p>Click, click, click, said the mock-crocs. They were Mrs. Sidney's shoes. She passed without mishap along the Avenue, over that flagstone with its wickedly raised edge where Mr. Tillotson had tripped last winter and sustained his fracture; they had petitioned the council. Mrs. Sidney's good legs, the legs of a woman of twenty-five, moved like scissors down the street. Her face was white and tired, her scarlet lips spoke of an effort at gaiety. She had carried the colour over the line of her thin lips, into a curvaceous bow; she had once read in a magazine that this could be done. Of what lies between the good legs and the sagging face, better not to speak; Mrs. Sidney never dwelled on her torso, she had given it up. She stopped by the house called "The Laburnums," by the straggling privet hedge spattered white with bird-droppings and ravaged by amateur topiary; and tears misted over her eyes. She wore the black coat with the mink trim.</p><p>Arthur had been with her when she bought the coat. It was budgeted for; the necessity had been weighed. Arthur had been embarrassed, standing among the garment rails; he had clasped his hands behind his back like Prince Philip, and with his eyes elsewhere he tried to look like a man deep in thought. She had not trailed him around the shops, she knew what she wanted. "A good coat," she said to him, "a good cloth coat is worth every penny you spend on it."</p><p>She had tried on two, and then the black. The salesgirl was sixteen. She was not interested in her job. She stood with one limp arm draped over the rail, her hip jutting out, watching Mrs. Sidney push the laden hangers to and fro. She did not know anything about the cut of a good cloth coat. Mrs. Sidney removed her gloves, and her fingers stroked the little mink collar appreciatively. She had tried to engage Arthur's attention, but he was not looking, and for a second she was shot through with resentment. Carelessly she tossed her old camelhair over a rail; until this morning it had been her best coat, but now it seemed shabby and inconsiderable. She unfastened the buttons carefully, slipped her arms into the silky lining. Turning to see the back in the long mirror, she smiled tentatively at the salesgirl. "Do you think the length...?"</p><p>The girl raised her thin shoulders in a shrug.</p><p>By now Arthur stood smiling at her indulgently, his hands still clasped behind his back.</p><p>"I will take it," Mrs. Sidney said. She minced towards Arthur.</p><p>"Very nice, dear," Arthur said. "Are you sure you've got what you wanted?"</p><p>She nodded, smiling. He would have been willing, she knew, to pay twenty pounds more, once he had agreed on the economy of a good cloth coat. Arthur did not stint. The girl laid it out by the cash register, flapped some tissue between its crossed arms and slid it, folded, into a big bag. Arthur took out a virgin chequebook, and his rolled-gold fountain pen. Precisely, he unscrewed the cap; smoothly, the ink flowed; with care, he replaced the cap and returned the pen to the inside pocket of his lovat sports jacket. Then, with a single neat pull, he removed the cheque and handed it courteously to the girl. Mrs. Sidney was proud of that, proud of the way the transaction had been carried through; how they did not pay in greasy bundles of notes like plumbers and housepainters. The carrier bag was heavy, with the good cloth coat inside it, and Arthur reached out without speaking and took it from her. He asked about a hat, so anxious was he to have everything correct; but she told him that people do not go in so much for hats nowadays. To be truthful, millinery departments intimidated her. The assistants looked at you scornfully, for so few of the people who tried on hats ever made a purchase; they had lost faith in human nature. She was happy. They had a cup of coffee and a cream cake each, and then they went home.</p><p>That night Arthur had his first stroke. When she got up in the morning, all the right side of his body was paralysed, and his mouth was twisted down at the corner; he couldn't speak. By eight o'clock he was lying on a high white bed at the General. She was sitting outside the ward, drinking the strong tea a nurse had given her out of a chipped white cup. All she could think was, you can get these cups as seconds on the market. Could that be where they get them? A hospital, could it be? He's on the free list, the nurse said, you can come at any time. When she went to see him he moved restlessly those parts he could move; he never again knew what day of the week it was, or anything at all about the world in the corridor or the market-place beyond. He suffered his second stroke while she was there, and they put lilac screens around the bed and informed her that he had passed away. She wore the black coat to his funeral.</p><p>Mrs. Sidney raised one elegant knee a little, to prop her bag on it, fumbled inside and took out a pink tissue. Standing by the stained and formless privet, she dabbed her eyes. She looked for a litterbin, but there were none in the Avenue. She screwed the tissue back into her handbag and scissored along the street.</p><p>The Axons' house stood on a corner. There was a little gate let in between the rhododendrons. No weeds pushed up between the stones of the path. And this was odd, because you would not have thought of Evelyn Axon as a keen gardener. There was stained glass in the door of the porch, venous crimson and the storm-dull blue of August skies. Mrs. Sidney stopped a pace from the door. She feared her nerve was going to fail her. Again she fumbled with her bag, patting for her purse to make sure it was still there. She did not know whether Mrs. Axon accepted payment. A small tickle of grief and fear rose up in her throat. She arrived at her decision; Mrs. Axon would already be watching from some window in the house. She placed her finger on the doorbell as if she were buttonholing the secret of the universe. It did not work.</p><p>But somewhere, in the dark interior of the house, Evelyn moved towards the door. She opened it just as Mrs. Sidney raised her hand to knock. Mrs. Sidney lowered her arm foolishly. Evelyn nodded.</p><p>"Come in," she said. "I suppose you want to speak to your late husband."</p><p>It was a nice detached property. As soon as she entered the hall behind Evelyn, Mrs. Sidney's eyes became viper-sharp. She took in the neglected parquet floor, the umbrella stand, the small table quite bare except for one potplant, withered and brown.</p><p>"Nothing seems to survive," Evelyn said.</p><p>Mrs. Sidney took a tighter grip on her bag.</p><p>"And into the front parlour," Evelyn said.</p><p>Then she kept her eyes on Evelyn's fawn cardigan, the bulky shape moving weightily ahead. It was a sunless room, seldom used; at this time Evelyn lived mostly at the back of the house. There were heavy curtains, a round dining-table in some dark wood, eight hard chairs with leather seats; a china cabinet, and two green armchairs placed at either side of the empty fireplace. "You'll want the fire," Evelyn said; she was nothing if not a good hostess. Mrs. Sidney took one of the armchairs, knees together, her handbag poised on them. Evelyn shuffled out and left her alone. She stared at the china cabinet, which was quite empty.</p><p>Evelyn returned with a little electric fire, two bars, dusty, the flex fraying. "If you don't mind," Mrs. Sidney said, "that's dangerous. Bare wires like that."</p><p>Evelyn slammed the plug firmly into the socket. As she stood up, she gave Mrs. Sidney what Mrs. Sidney called a straight look, the kind of look that is given to people who speak out of turn. "Make yourself comfortable, Mrs. Sidney," she said.</p><p>Once again, Mrs. Sidney was struck by the cultured tone of Evelyn's voice. She was, had been, what old-fashioned people called a lady. She and her husband had lived in this house when these few dank autumnal avenues were the best addresses in town. The Axons had always kept to themselves. For years the neighbours had complained about Evelyn's ways, about the odd times at which she hung out her washing, about her habit of muttering to herself in the queue at the Post Office. Yet, Mrs. Sidney thought, she was a cut above. In a way she was a very tragic woman; Mrs. Sidney had a nose for tragedy these days, alerted to it by her own. "You'll have to excuse my not providing tea," Evelyn said. "It's not convenient. I'm not going into the kitchen today." Mrs. Sidney blinked. For want of reply, her eyes slid back to the empty china cabinet.</p><p>"Smashed," Evelyn said. "All smashed years ago."</p><p>Evelyn went over to the sideboard. It was, Mrs. Sidney noted, the most modern piece of furniture in the room. It had one of those compartments for drinks, and a flap that came down to serve them on. Evelyn pulled it down. Mrs. Sidney gaped. She could make out the labels from here; baked beans, salmon, ox-tongue. Evelyn reached into the back and took out a half-full bottle of orange squash. From a cupboard, she took two glasses and poured a careful measure into each. On the table stood a jug of lukewarm water. Evelyn set down one of the glasses by her guest's side, and took the armchair opposite.</p><p>"I expect you will want to talk about him a little," she said. She sat upright and alert, watching her visitor, noting how the face-powder had caked at the side of her nose, how the open pores of her cheeks shone, how the body mocked the pretty, lively legs. And suddenly Mrs. Sidney crumpled, as if she had been dealt a blow; her bag slid from her knees to the floor, her shoulders sagged, great gouts of grief came dropping from her mouth. Yes, Evelyn thought, how they steer you to cheerful topics; how after twice meeting they cross the road and pretend that they didn't see you so that they can avoid the whole embarrassing encounter: a widow. There is, Evelyn reflected, a custom known as Suttee; to judge by their behaviour, many seemed to think its suppression an unhealthy development.</p><p>She watched. Mrs. Sidney's mouth worked, and the scarlet line of lipstick above her top lip contorted independently of the mouth, so that her face seemed to be slipping in and out of some grotesque and ludicrous mask. The woman lurched forward; her hands scrabbled for her bag and she scrubbed at her face with the pink tissues and dropped them in sodden balls on the carpet and onto the chair. Evelyn reached for her orange juice and took a sip. She put down the glass carefully, on a mat with a fringe. "Mr. Sidney was a good husband to you," she suggested.</p><p>Mrs. Sidney talked about the buying of the coat, of the cakes they had eaten, of the vast corridors of the hospital with its draughts and swinging firedoors; the stained walls, the starched impatience of doctors' coats and the dreadful grimace of his paralysed mouth. As she talked she gasped and retched at the memories, but in the end she calmed herself, sat upright and shaking on the edge of the chair, her legs crossed tightly and her eyes formless and red. She was ready to begin.</p><p>"Mr. Sidney's line of work was with the Transport Authority," she said carefully. She spoke as if each of her words was a precious crystal glass coming out of a crate; one slip could shatter her again.</p><p>"You mean the bus company?" Evelyn said.</p><p>"It was a kind of insurance work. When--if, you see, there was an accident, someone was in an accident on the bus, he would be finding out what happened and deciding how much the bus--the Transport Authority--ought to pay out for it. He was called a Claims Investigation Agent."</p><p>"Yes," Evelyn said. "He was a clerk. I understand. Now I will tell you, Mrs. Sidney, sometimes I meet with success and sometimes I don't. If you would call it success; I would say, results. It appears that they tell some people that all is very beautiful on the ninth plane and that there are flowers and organ music, but they never said that to me, and if they do say it I think they must be confusing it with the funeral. It would be a natural mistake.

The most influential book in the Western canon that does not actually belong to it, The Arabian Nights never enjoyed the same literary status in the East, and its origins have been made only murkier by its reception in Europe. Irwin begins with the translators who popularized the Nights and, along the way, bowdlerized and warped it, or even inserted their own episodes. Most famously, Aladdin, who has no Arabic version predating his appearance in 18th-century France, may well have been the creation of translator Antoine Galland, not of Scheherazade. Irwin wryly glosses these early translations, which distortedly mirror the original Eastern exoticism with the reflections of their age's prejudices and their translators' personal eccentricities (notably the lexical, racial, and sexual obsessions of the Victorian adventurer Sir Richard Burton). The earlier Arabic compilations are no more reliable, however--Irwin devotes a separate chapter to forerunners (conjectural or lost) over several centuries, from India to Persia and Egypt. In a quixotic effort to amass 1,001 actual tales, these medieval compilers would incorporate local legends and real settings, sometimes approaching souk storytellers as sources. Throughout, Irwin's scholarly acumen illuminates these myriad worlds of the Nights, whether the cityscapes of the Mamelukes, the urban rogues' gallery of thieves and bazaar magicians, or the marvels of jinn and clockwork birds. The longest chapter is a selected roster of its literary heirs, from nursery fables and gothic novels through Proust, Joyce, and Borges, to contemporaries like Salman Rushdie and John Barth. An enchanting dragoman and chaperon for sleepless nights with Scheherazade. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Some critics say genocide characterized the early conduct of Indian affairs in the state; others say humanitarian concerns. Robert F. Heizer, in the former camp, has compiled a damning collection of contemporaneous accounts that will provoke students of California history to look deeply into the state&#39;s record of race relations and to question bland generalizations about the adventuresome days of the Gold Rush.</p><p>The Destruction of California Indians is so powerful that every American should read it. These accounts of the activities of agents, military officers, and newspapers reveal how thousands of California natives died from 1847 to 1865 from starvation, disease, drunkenness, enslavement, rape, murder, and warfare...The editor lets the documents tell the story and has provided organization and balance which make it possible to trace themes while letting the reader draw the conclusions.

Slonimsky has been admired as much for his style as for the information he has shared. A tribute to his career as a conductor, composer, teacher, and writer, this compendium celebrates Slonimsky&#39;s life and work. Featuring selections from &#34;Baker&#39;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&#34;, &#34;Music Since 1900&#34;, &#34;Lexicon of Musical Invective&#34;. &#34;Lectionary of Music&#34;, Slonimsky&#39;s autobiography &#34;Perfect Pitch&#34;, and his notorious paper &#34;Sex and the Music Librarian&#34;, Nicolas Slonimskv compiles 60 years of classic commentary.</p><p>Editor Kostelanetz has collected some of Slonimsky's greatest articles, biographies, musical definitions, and observations of the 20th century. As a composer, conductor, and prolific writer, Slonimsky virtually defines 20th-century musical scholarship with his well-known editorial work in Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians ( LJ 1/92), as well as numerous other books and journal articles. The new work presents a broad enough view of music, in both historical scope and content, to appeal to both musician and music lover. Slonimsky's famous sense of humor emerges in full force, especially in biographical pieces on popular musicians like Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatra. The inclusion of such items as Slonimsky's timeline of 20th-century opera libretti and his infamous censorship lecture, "Sex and the Music Librarian," gives some idea of the all-inclusive nature of the book. Recommended for public libraries and academic libraries from the high school to the graduate level.<br><i>- James E. Perone, Canisius Coll., Buffalo, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Nicolas Slonimsky has had a career in music that would be remarkable for its longevity alone. Born in Russia in 1894, he remains active today, including as an editor of such standard musical reference works as <i>Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians</i>. Slonimsky is, however, much more than a mere centenarian. He is one of the seminal figures in this century's musical avant garde and probably the only person ever who can claim to have premiered works of Charles Ives under the composer's active supervision and also have his own compositions performed in a Frank Zappa concert. Moreover, Slonimsky is one of music writing's deadlier shots. Many of his works target various forms of musical convention and deftly fell them with lethal turns of phrase. The book at hand collects some of Slonimsky's more outrageous essays (e.g., "Sex and the Music Librarian") and the juicier excerpts from his reference works. Kostelanetz has edited this, one of the more entertaining books on music, with consummate care; it is refreshing to see such love transmuted into print. <i>John Shreffler</i></p><h2>Grief</h2><p><strong>In the tradition of Michael Cunningham's <em>The Hours</em></strong>, a beautiful novel destined to become a classic<p>Reeling from the recent death of his invalid mother, a worn, jaded professor comes to our nation's capital to recuperate from his loss. What he finds there -- in his repressed, lonely landlord, in the city's mood and architecture, and in the letters and journals of Mary Todd Lincoln -- shows him new, poignant truths about America, yearning, loneliness, and mourning itself.</p><p>Since Andrew Holleran first burst onto the scene with 1978's groundbreaking <em>Dancer from the Dance</em>, which has been continuously in print, he has been dazzling readers and critics with his haunting, brilliant prose. The Publishing Triangle ranks <em>Dancer from the Dance</em> at #15 on its list of the 100 best lesbian and gay novels ever, along with titles by Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf. A new Andrew Holleran book is a major literary event; with <em>Grief</em>, Holleran is poised to reach a wider audience than ever before.</p></p><p>Andrew Holleran is the author of three novels, <em>Dancer from the Dance</em> (a<em>NYT</em> notable book), <em>Nights in Aruba</em>, and <em>The Beauty of Men</em>. He has also written a book of essays,<em>Ground Zero</em>, and a book of short stories, <em>In September the Light Changes</em>. He lives in Washington, D.C."The beautiful life was brief."<p> These words, from Constantine Cavafy's poem "In the Evening," could serve as an epigraph for the body of work produced over the last 28 years by Andrew Holleran. Holleran's 1978 debut novel, Dancer from the Dance , was hailed for its groundbreaking and unapologetic account of gay life in the post-Stonewall era. Its themes and swooping prose owed much to Proust and F. Scott Fitzgerald, especially The Great Gatsby. When one rereads it now, nearly three decades later, the novel seems eerily prescient of the devastating effect the AIDS epidemic had upon the gay community (and continues to have throughout the world).</p><p> But in its wake, a generation of gay men came to build their own glittering clubs and mansions and memories upon a landscape that for many years resembled a war zone. Most of Holleran's later writings -- two novels, a story collection, the searing essays in Ground Zero, one of the best dispatches from the epidemic's height -- have dealt with these survivors.</p><p> Grief, his haunting and unexpectedly exhilarating new novel, takes his longtime themes -- loss, desire, the deep joy and solace humans derive from their homes and surroundings -- and distills them into a heady, bittersweet aperitif. And like the best aperitifs, this slender novel whets one's appetite for an entire meal of the author's other work.</p><p> The unnamed narrator has arrived in Washington, D.C., to teach a university seminar on Literature and AIDS. In addition to the systemic sense of loss shared by many gay men of his generation, he feels a nearly insuperable burden of guilt over his mother's death, compounded because he never came out to her. He rents a room near Dupont Circle, in a townhouse he shares with his landlord, another middle-aged gay man. The two pass each other on the stairs and sometimes in the kitchen. Occasionally, these fleeting encounters extend into conversations but nothing more intimate. In his free time, the narrator walks around the city or reads a book he has found in his bedroom: "Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters."</p><p> That's pretty much it for plot.</p><p> Yet, as with the fiction of James Salter -- the writer Holleran's prose most evokes -- this slender volume conjures up a rich and deeply seductive, satisfying world, one that welcomes readers gay, straight, single, coupled or otherwise.</p><p> Despite its title and minor-key ending, Grief is not a depressing book. "Beauty does not lose its allure under the spell of grief," Holleran writes in one of his essays, and Grief is suffused with beauty -- not just the beauty of men but the beauty of the city whose streets the narrator wanders as though in a waking dream. I have never read a novel that so powerfully and movingly evokes D.C. -- its spirit, its ideal essence. "People never say anything nice about Washington," a character laments, but Grief provides a potent corrective. Like Cavafy leading one through the alleys and restaurants and history of Alexandria, Egypt, Holleran's narrator is a guide to the labyrinth of ambition, death, art and desire that lies within L'Enfant'scarefully executed grid of streets and parks: "The National Archives had the same cold light as the Tomb of Napoleon," he writes, "and the National Gallery made you feel, when you entered the echoing rotunda, and walked between its dark marble pillars, you were entering the palace of Pluto."</p><p>"They will make wonderful ruins," Sen. Thomas P. Gore, grandfather of Gore Vidal, once remarked to a visitor enthusing over Washington's architectural marvels. Until they do, they make a wonderful setting for Holleran's acute and often droll observations of the city.</p><p> The parallels between Grief's emotionally immured protagonist and Mary Lincoln, ravaged and ultimately destroyed by grief over her husband's death, are evident but not overplayed. And the narrator's decision as to how to live the remainder of his life seems as etched in stone as the words he reads on the city's monuments. Still, in the end, Holleran's moving novel is mostly about human resilience and hope; our enduring need to love, despite our losses. The beautiful life is brief: all the more reason to embrace it. </p><p>Reviewed by Elizabeth Hand <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

This year, series editor David Lehman's temperature-taking preface reminds us of Ruth Lilly's colossal $100 million bequest to Poetry Magazine, and notes that you can now collect poet cards and purchase poet swimsuit calendars. The contributors' notes at the back of the book eat up more available pages than usual as they recount what particular works of art or jazz tracks made the authors write their "best" poems, while a modest voice indicates that this marks their 8th or 10th appearance in the series. Guest editor Komunyakaa (Neon Vernacular, 1994) argues that the avant-garde, which he terms the "exploratory" movement, exists as "a poetry that borders on cultivated solecism and begs theorists to decipher it" and that it is "death in language"; by contrast, the poetry he has chosen "has content." Finally, the poems themselves appear; here are fresh gems from Richard Howard, W. S. Merwin, Galway Kinnell (a spectacular threnody on the fall of New York's World Trade Center towers), Carolyn Kizer, Rita Dove, Richard Wilbur, James Tate, Louise Gleck, Philip Levine, C.K. Williams, and the three most recent Pulitzer Prize winners, Stephen Dunn, Carl Dennis and Paul Muldoon. Two other poets stand out-Amy Gerstler contributes an amusing Gilda Radner-like piece about misreading a mailer that wants to send her "Beethoven's Greatest Symphonies," while Ruth Stone (b. 1915) gives the proceedings a suitably youthful air with her speculative "Lines": "Voice, perhaps you are the universe;/ the hum of spiders."

Sputnik, all of 184 pounds with only a radio transmitter inside its highly polished shell, became the first man-made object in space; while it immediately shocked the world, its long-term impact was even greater, for it profoundly changed the shape of the twentieth century. </p><p>In his upcoming book, Washington journalist Paul Dickson chronicles the dramatic events and developments leading up to and emanating from Sputnik's launch. Supported by groundbreaking, original research and many recently declassified documents, <i>Sputnik</i> offers a fascinating profile of the early American and Soviet space programs and a strikingly revised picture of the politics and personalities behind the facade of America's fledgling efforts to get into space. </p><p>Although Sputnik was unmanned, its story is intensely human. Sputnik owed its success to many people, from the earlier visionary, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, whose theories were ahead of their time, to the Soviet spokesmen strategically positioned around the world on the day the satellite was launched, who created one of the greatest public-relations events of all time. Its chief designer, however&#x2015;the brilliant Sergei Korolev&#x2015;remained a Soviet state secret until after his death. </p><p>Equally hidden from view was the political intrigue dominating America's early space program, as the military services jockeyed for control and identity in a peacetime world. For years, former Nazi Wernher von Braun, who ran the U.S. Army's missile program, lobbied incessantly that his Rocket Team should be handed responsibility for the first Earth-orbiting satellite. He was outraged that Sputnik beat him and America into space. For his part, President Eisenhower was secretly pleased that the Russians had launched first, because by orbiting over the United States Sputnik established the principle of "freedom of space" that could justify the spy satellites he thought essential to monitor Soviet missile buildup. As Dickson reveals, Eisenhower was, in fact, much more a master of the Sputnik crisis than he appeared to be at the time and in subsequent accounts.</p><p>The U.S. public reaction to Sputnik was monumental. In a single weekend, Americans were wrenched out of a mood of national smugness and post-war material comfort. Initial shock at and fear of the Soviets' intentions galvanized the country and swiftly prompted innovative developments that define our world today. Sputnik directly or indirectly influenced nearly every aspect of American life, from the demise of the suddenly superfluous tail fin and an immediate shift towards science in the classroom to the arms race that defined the cold war, the competition to reach the Moon, and the birth of the Internet. </p><p>By shedding new light on a pivotal era, Paul Dickson expands our knowledge of the world we now inhabit, and reminds us that the story of Sputnik goes far beyond technology and the beginning of the space age, and that its implications are still being felt today.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Dickson</b> is the author of more than forty books, including <i>The Joy of Keeping Score</i>, <i>The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary</i>, <i>Baseball's Greatest Quotations</i>, and <i>Baseball: The Presidents' Game</i>. In addition to baseball, his specialties include Americana and language. He lives in Garrett Park, Maryland.</p>October 4, 1957, was my tenth birthday. Long after the festivities, I was in bed, snuggled under my Roy Rogers bedspread and enjoying my best present--a new transistor radio in a snappy leather case. This was a clandestine operation since I had been ordered to go to sleep hours ago. The radio, under the cover of Roy, was playing softly as I scanned the dial. Rather than the rock 'n' roll I sought, what I heard was the excited voice of a newscaster discussing something called Sputnik, a Russian satellite that had just been launched and, judging by the newscaster's agitated tone, should be a cause of great concern to everyone.<p>At this point, my knowledge of the Russians was a bit sketchy. I knew, of course, that they were the bad guys, responsible for making me practice hiding under my desk to ward off fallout in the event of a nuclear attack. I knew, too, that the Russians were supposed to be very smart and very tough. I knew this because my uncle often chided my cousin and I for our lag-about ways by telling us that someday we were going to have to fight the Russians, and he--a veteran of the European theater in World War II--happened to know that they were "smart, tough sons of bitches." His prediction seemed to be coming true on my tenth birthday. I hadn't expected to be forced to fight the Russians quite so soon, and I certainly hadn't expected to contend with missiles fired from the moon (which the newscaster was saying would be the inevitable next step, after Sputnik). I didn't yet know how to spell Sputnik, but I did know it was big trouble.</p><p>In the following days and weeks, I quickly realized that I wasn't the only one worried about the Russians and their satellites, but somehow I never lost the notion that the first Sputnik belonged to me. In some part of my mind, I think I assumed that I was the first private citizen in the U.S. to hear the news. Who else would be up in the middle of the night listening to the radio? (In fact, the launch had occurred some hours before I heard about it, but it was inconceivable to me that anything newsworthy might have taken place during my birthday party.) So even as the decades rolled by, as the word Sputnik first became a part of popular culture and then receded from center stage, I continued to nod quietly to myself every time I heard the name, secure in the belief that, although everyone claimed a knowledge of Sputnik, I had a special, even secret, relationship with it.</p><p>About 20 years ago, when I happened to interview Stephen King, I had my first inkling that I might have to share a little bit of Sputnik. It turns out that King was also celebrating his tenth birthday in the fall of 1957 (on September 21, just a few days before the launch) and was also shaken by the idea of the Russians in space--so much so that he contends to this day that Sputnik was a key factor in his becoming a writer of horror fiction. Well, maybe so, but he wasn't born on October 4, and he didn't have a Roy Rogers bedspread. </p><p>After reading Paul Dickson's fascinating Sputnik: The Shock of the Century, I'm afraid my illusions are shattered once and for all. Sputnik was a slut, a tramp, and she enjoyed special relationships with virtually the entire population of the U.S. alive on October 4, 1957. Dickson has all the details: the Stephen King story is there, but that's just the beginning. Little Richard was so shocked by the appearance of Sputnik in the sky as he was performing an outdoor concert that he renounced rock 'n' roll (temporarily) and became a preacher. Ross Perot was inspired by Sputnik to create an electronics dynasty. And countless other Americans, great and small, remember the launch of Sputnik as a turning point in their lives. Damn.</p><p>As disappointed as I was to read of Sputnik's infidelity, I was also caught up in the scientific and social history surrounding the satellite's creation and its aftermath. Dickson makes the space race come alive in layman's language, and he shows how the shock of the Russians being first at something galvanized this country in all sorts of far-reaching ways. Who would have thought, for example, that Sputnik was responsible for the Summer of Love? Here's how it worked: Sputnik proved the Russians were doing a better job than we were at education, prompting the National Defense Education Act, which stressed science but also advocated creative and independent thought. A generation removed from Sputnik, young people wearied of science but used their NDEA-funded independent thinking skills to challenge the establishment on everything from civil rights and Vietnam to long hair and free love. That Sputnik was some satellite--but I've known that for 44 years. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Told in alternating voices of Vivi and the Petite Ya-Yas, Siddalee and Baylor Walker, as well as other denizens of Thornton, Louisiana, YA-YAS IN BLOOM show us the Ya-Yas in love and at war with convention. Through crises of faith and hilarious lapses of parenting skills, brushes with alcoholism and glimpses of the dark reality of racial bigotry, the Ya-Ya values of unconditional loyalty, high style, and Cajun sass shine through. Necies wise credo, "Just think pretty pink and blue thoughts," helps too...</p><p>But in the Ya-Yas' inimitable way, these four remarkable women also teach their children about the Mysteries: the wonder of snow in the deep South, the possibility that humans are made of stars, and the belief that miracles do happen. And they need a miracle when old grudges and wounded psyches lead to a heartbreaking crime...and the dynamic web of sisterhood is the only safety net strong enough to hold families together and endure.</p><p>After two bestsellers and a blockbuster movie, the Ya-Yas have become part of American culture -- icons for the power of women's friendship. YA-YAS IN BLOOM continues the saga, giving us more Ya-Ya lore, spun out in the rich patois of the Louisiana bayou country and brim full of the Ya-Ya message to embrace life and each other with joy.</p></p><p><p>Writer, actor, and playwright Rebecca Wells is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Ya-Yas in Bloom</em>, <em>Little Altars Everywhere</em>, and <em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em>, which was made into a feature film. A native of Louisiana, she now lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest.</p>Tony Award winner Judith Ivey may not be from Louisiana, but there's no doubt her heart belongs to the home of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and the highly acclaimed sagas of the Southern belles. In this newest addition, Ivey reveals the beginnings of the Ya-Yas' friendship in the 1930s, sixty years of marriages, children, scandals, and the bond that holds them together. She flawlessly performs the stories as dozens of easily identifiable, believable characters, not only in the purrs and hisses (often tinged with booze) of the beloved Ya-Yas, but also the giggly lisps of the 4-years-olds and the roaring, blustering bassos of powerful Southern gents. If ever there was a match made in heaven, Ivey and the Ya-Yas are it. M.T.B.

His book Watching Babylon, about the Iraq war as seen on TV and in film, was described by art historian Terry Smith as &#39;a tour de force by perhaps the most inventive - certainly the most wide-ranging - practitioner of visual culture analysis in the world today.&#39;A dizzying and delightful book * New Scientist * Deploying a blend of semiotics, sociology, and art history, Mirzoeff shows us how to interpret everything from old masters to selfies, from Rashomon to a map of the Mississippi. Mirzoeff says he owes much of his approach to John Berger, and this is evident in the way he argues how inevitably political visual images are... Mirzoeff draws on theorists such as Benjamin, Foucault, and Deleuze, but thankfully is much clearer and easier to read than any of those writers * Independent on Sunday * In our fluid world, we need reminding how strange our visual culture has become. Artist John Berger did that job for the 1970s with his classic book Ways of Seeing; now Nicholas Mirzoeff teaches us how to &#34;read&#34; an astronaut&#39;s 2012 space-walk selfie - and how to decode military photos smothered with labels that claim to show weapons we cannot in fact see -- New Scientist &#39;Books of the Year&#39;</p><h2>Clea (Alexandria Quartet)</h2><p>In the final volume of the &#34;Alexandrian Quartet&#34;, Darley returns to Alexandria now caught by war-fever.

The story is supplemented by music from Debussy, Ravel, Britten and Piazzola.</p><p><b>Lawrence Durrell </b>was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St. Edmund's School, Canterbury. His first literary work, <i>The Black Book</i>, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, <i>A Private Country</i>, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: <i>Prospero's Cell</i>; <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i>, about Rhodes; and <i>Bitter Lemons</i>, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell's wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, <i>The Alexandria Quartet</i>, which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the quartet and <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> he wrote the two-decker <i>Tunc </i>and <i>Nunquam</i>. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. <i>Caesar's Vast Ghost</i>, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, was published a few days before his death in Sommi�res in 1990.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with JUSTINE, MOUNTOLIVE, and BALTHAZAR.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

Taking place during the course of a year, her experiences range from the dramatic (a cyclone, a fire, the death of a family friend) to the ordinary (a cider pressing, the annual hog butchering, and the family's first look at the brand new Sears Roebuck catalog). Throughout, Rose is a changing, growing character. Her relationships with others evolve in a natural way that children are bound to relate to, and the awakening of her intellectual curiosity and her transition from childhood to adolescence is authentically depicted. MacBride is obviously fascinated with historical detail, which generally serves this book well, although its length will intimidate many children, and some of the descriptions are perhaps a bit too leisurely. The plotting is where the book lacks structure and cohesiveness; it is episodic to the point of being rambling, with some plot elements just fizzling out (for example, all of the little bits about omens and superstitions never lead up to anything). All in all, though, this is a respectable book worthy of consideration, especially where the series is already popular.<br><i>Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, IL</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Working in the Dark: Reflections of a Poet of the Barrio: Reflections of a Poet of the Barrio (Red Crane Literature Series)</h2><p>Baca passionately explores the troubled years of his youth, from which he emerged with heightened awareness of his ethnic identify as a Chicano, his role as a witness for the misunderstood tribal life of the barrio, and his redemptive vocation as a poet.</p><p>Jimmy Santiago Baca was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1952. His parents abandoned him at the age of two, and he lived with his grandmother for several years before being placed in an orphanage. A runaway at age thirteen, Baca was sentenced to five years in a maximum security prison at the age of twenty-one for drug offenses. It was in prison that he learned to read and write and began to compose poetry. His book Martin &amp; Meditations on the South Valley, a pair of long narrative poems, won an American Book Award in 1988. In addition to his poetry collections and stories, Baca wrote the screenplay for the movie Bound by Honor, which was released by Hollywood Pictures in 1993.The story revealed in these mid-life recollections by Chicano poet Baca is absorbing: an orphan child in a New Mexican city or town name not given/MM barrio, poorly schooled, immersed in drugs and petty crime, he only discovered the power of language as a convict, on reading Neruda and Paz: "Their language was the magic that could liberate me from myself, transform me into another person, transport me to other places far away." This volume is less an autobiography than a romantic paean, taking form as a series of essays, to the redemptive, ecstatic capabilities of poetry. Baca sees his vocation in transcendental terms: "I became one with the air and sky, the dirt and the iron and the concrete"; he regards himself as a voice for the poor and oppressed in America. As a self-ordained spokesperson for Chicanos, he is at his best when evoking barrio culture: his stately grandmother, the village cantinas and the quiet solidarity of Mexican workers. The book finally disappoints, however; too many reflections are self-indulgent, gratuitously profane, incoherent or simply lost in torturous metaphors. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Absolute Bourgeois: Artists and Politics in France, 1848-1851</h2><p>When this book and its companion volume, <i>Image of the People</i>, appeared in 1973, they were taken as a challenge to the way art was usually written about. "This book," said the <i>Times</i>, "is a product of that school of art history whose history is as well read as its art, and whilst it covers only a small area of time and place, Clark's approach and style are such that it throws up enough ideas and pleasures to illuminate far beyond its rather special circumstances. It is suffused with wit and pathetic irony."<br><br>T. J. Clark's subject is painting and printmaking in the years following the 1848 Revolution in France, "a time", he argues, "when art and politics could not escape each other." The book tells the story of a handful of artists trying to take advantage of that unfamiliar&#x2014;and short-lived&#x2014;situation. Daumier and Millet are central, particularly in their dealings with the new State's art patronage machine; Delacroix figures as painter and diarist, in agonized withdrawal from the possibility of change, haunted by his own <i>Liberty Guiding the People</i>; and Baudelaire is depicted, after a moment of tortured political involvement in the first months of the Republic, as the great poet of postrevolutionary despair.</p><p><b>T. J. Clark</b> is Chancellor's Professor of Modern Art at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of <i>The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and his Followers</i> (1984) and <i>Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism</i> (1999)."A marvelous and compelling book, which deserves to be read with care by all concerned with art, politics, and society." -- <i><i>Arts Review</i></i></p><h2>Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons</h2><p>Jack Parsons was a brilliant scientist whose innovations in solid rocket fuel were responsible for Allied air victories in WWII as well as early advances in space flight. A cofounder of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, he was honored by NASA for his accomplishments when they named a moon crater after him. But outside the laboratory, Parsons immersed himself in a shadowy world unknown to his professional colleagues -- a world where Parsons practiced occult rituals with his mentor, Aleister Crowley, a self-professed Antichrist. When Parsons befriended L. Ron Hubbard, who later ran off with Parsons&#39;s money and his wife, his life became even more peculiar. Ultimately, his increasingly obsessive experiments -- he aimed to create a creature with magical powers -- sparked a chemical explosion that killed him.</p><p>Scientist, poet, and self-proclaimed Antichrist, Jack Parsons was a bizarre genius whose life reads like an implausible yet irresistible science fiction novel. <i>Sex and Rockets</i> looks at his short life and dual career as cofounder of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and leader of the Agape Lodge of Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Author John Carter scours primary documents and interviews surviving friends and contemporaries to deliver an intriguing portrait of a dreamy, driven man equally interested in rocketry and magick. From his early childhood and deep attachment to his mother (who killed herself hours after he died) through his nonacademic research and brilliant innovations in solid fuels to his mysterious 1952 demise in a garage-laboratory explosion at the age of 37, the reader gets the impression of a man whose obsession with explosives and propellants was nearly single-minded. Yet this same man found spiritual fulfillment through Crowley's Law of Thelema, conducted magickal operations with L. Ron Hubbard, and signed an oath asserting himself to be the Antichrist--clearly Parsons wasn't a boring guy in a white coat. Carter pulls off the difficult task of integrating Parsons's disparate drives into one compelling story; though there are some rough spots and awkward transitions, one gets the sense that this illuminates the man's life better than a smooth, flawless work would. Robert Anton Wilson's introduction is smart and funny as always, initiating the uninformed into the basics of Crowleyanity while placing Parsons in the context of his times. While it might not be possible to read universal themes into Parsons's life, <i>Sex and Rockets</i> is an excellent study of a passionate life fully lived. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><h2>An Antic Disposition</h2><p>In 1204 A.D., the Fools' Guild is on the run from an enraged Pope Innocent III and the Papal troops he's dispatched to destroy them. Now, hidden in their secret enclave deep within the Black Forest, the fools, troubadours and novitiates, including the jester couple Theophilos and Claudia, come together for their evening gathering to hear Father Gerald, their ancient leader, tell one of the greatest stories from the history of the Guild.<br><br>It begins in Denmark, during a time of civil war when three men laid claim to the throne while a fourth watched and bided his time. Into the strategically crucial town of Slesvig, the Guild sends Terence of York, who is promptly dubbed Yorick by the Duke's young son, Amleth. What unfolds is a tale of treachery, tragedy and bloodshed that is the true story behind one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies. But Father Gerald's history contains secrets never known to anyone outside the Guild, and as he recounts it, Theophilos feels a chill steal over his heart. <br><br>For not even Father Gerald knows the ending of this story. But Theophilos does.<br></p><p>Alan Gordon is an attorney with the Legal Aid Society of New York and author of four previous books featuring Theophilos, the jester. He lives with his family in Queens, New York. <br>In his fifth medieval mystery (after 2003's Widow of Jerusalem), Gordon puts a delightful and original spin on Shakespeare's Hamlet: Prince of Denmark. In 1204, the members of the Fool's Guild are in hiding in the Black Forest. To while away an evening, Father Gerald, an elderly priest, recounts the efforts of an upstart Danish lord, the prototype of Hamlet's father, to win the Danish throne in the mid-12th century. Father Gerald relates his story through the eyes of the court jester, Yorick, who is adored by the lord's young son, Amleth. Father Gerald's fellow fool, Theophilus, tells the second half of the story, providing an insightful, alternative version of what happens in Hamlet, at the same time revealing more of his own background than was previously known. Gordon deftly shifts point-of-view among his principals, each of whom expands and reimagines the events in the Shakespeare play. What emerges is a riveting tale of ambition, subterfuge, betrayal and revenge. It takes a bold author to rewrite the Bard, but Gordon has made an excellent job of it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Beginning with the Seven Years War (1756^-63), which put England in debt and led to new taxes on its colonies, Kroll tells of the decisions of Parliament and the reactions of the colonists, focusing on the situation in Boston. He ends with the famous Tea Party, though an afterword summarizes the events that followed. Although Kroll does a creditable job of summarizing history, the text reads more like a chapter from a history book than a picture-book text. The lack of a central character or a series of dramatic incidents must have made the book difficult to illustrate. One spread, for example, shows a crowd of faceless people surrounding the Liberty Tree at a distance and watching for tea agents, who never show up. The impressionistic paintings are quite handsome on their own, but they generally keep readers at a distance from the action, even when some sort of action is taking place. Still, middle-grade children researching the period may be glad to find an illustrated book that provides reliable information on the subject.

Whether it&#x2019;s just-in-season asparagus, a gorgeous steak beckoning from the butcher&#x2019;s case, or the sweetest August corn that catches your eye, Zakarian helps you turn it into a quick weeknight meal or Sunday supper&#x2014;a Country recipe&#x2014;or elegant Saturday-night dinner-party fare&#x2014;a Town preparation. <br><br>Zakarian&#x2019;s inventive, flavorful creations for ingredients that run the gamut from the humble apple to luxurious lobsters include:<br><br>TOWN&#x2014; Ribeye Steaks with Wilted Watercress and Romaine Marmalade<br>COUNTRY&#x2014; Grilled Flank Steak with Smoked Barbecue Sauce<br><br>TOWN&#x2014; Arugula Cannelloni with Chanterelle Sauce<br>COUNTRY&#x2014; Ziti with Arugula Pesto and Crispy Prosciutto <br><br>TOWN&#x2014; Poached Salmon Tartare with Avocado, Fennel, and Vinaigrette<br>COUNTRY&#x2014; Grilled Salmon with Smashed Cucumber&#x2013;Date Salad<br><br>TOWN Liquid Gold Chocolate Tart<br>COUNTRY&#x2014; Deep Dark Chocolate Pudding <br><br>Featuring stunning full-color photographs and an approach that is at once familiar and fantastic, comfortable and creative, <i>Geoffrey Zakarian&#x2019;s Town/Country</i> pre-sents the perfect combination for amateur to ambitious American cooks.<br>From Acorn Squash to Zucchini&#x2014;150 recipes arranged by ingredient to fit your pantry and your mood</p><p>Geoffrey Zakarian is the chef-owner of Manhattan's Town restaurant, a spot acclaimed for its polished cooking. In <i>Town/Country</i>, he offers "town" recipes from the restaurant partnered by less dressy "country" formulas, which aren't, however, always easier to accomplish--130 dishes in all. The conceit here is to provide a town and country recipe for each of 65 "favorite" ingredients, ranging from acorn squash to zucchini--pairings like Chicken Confit Salad and Peri-Peri Chicken; Mackerel Escabeche with Zucchini Noodles and Warm Mackerel with Basil Chiffonade and Zucchini Vinaigrette; and Raspberry and Honey Crisps with Greek Yogurt and Flourless Raspberry Souffl�. The dishes, which include imaginative reworkings of classics like Duck � l&#x2019;Orange, are always attractive; readers should be aware, however, that this is "cheffy" cooking, and as such demands a kitchen commitment as well as ingredients that can be hard to find, expensive, or both. The organization by ingredient, which results in mixing savory and sweet recipes, also makes it difficult to find formulas for a particular course. The book includes photos of the dishes and of the author shopping, cooking, and musing. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>Geoffrey Zakarian has manned the stoves at some of the world&#x2019;s best restaurants over the past twenty years, including Arp�ge in Paris and the Dorchester in London.

A sharpie is a long, narrow, flat-bottom craft that evolved in the 19th century along the Connecticut shore as an oyster fisherman's boat. An 1880 report by the U.S. Census Bureau characterized the sharpie as "so good a fishing boat and so fast a yacht that it has been adopted in a great many other localities throughout the United States." To this add three more superlatives--easy, cheap, and fast to build--and you have the keys to the sharpie's almost cultlike popularity among backyard boatbuilders.</p><p><b>Reuel B.

Abrams, which helped to arrange the initial exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., here publishes the entire collection of Wyeth's renderings of his neighbor Helga Testorf, with a text by the gallery's deputy director. There is also a rather foolish piece by Andrews ("I personally feel he is so far ahead of any other living artist that it is hard to name the second best"). The pictures, meticulously reproduced, range widely in mood, from sensuous nudes to somber studies of Helga in assorted rustic landscapes and interiors; they are examples of fine craftsmanship but continue to leave open the question of whether Wyeth is more than a highly skilled illustrator with a flair for drama and atmosphere. In any case, the controversy in the art world about Wyeth's stature (merely hinted at in a footnote here), and the traditional romantic speculation about artist and model, seem certain to fuel sales. 400,000 first printing; BOMC main selection. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.For 15 years, America's most popular living artist worked in secret with neighbor Helga Testorf as model.

After all, Blake is a single man in possession of a good fortune, and thus must be in want of a wife.<br><br> But when it turns out that what Blake actually wants is more of a hook-up than a honeymoon, Emma is hurt, betrayed, and furious. She throws herself deeper into her work as CMO of Kinetics, the fastest growing gym franchise in the nation. She loves her work, and she's good at it, which is why she bristles when her boss brings in a consultant to help her spearhead the new facilities on the East Coast. Her frustration turns to shock when that consultant turns out to be Blake's younger brother, Lucas.<br><br> Emma is determined not to fall for Lucas, but as she gets to know him, she realizes that Lucas is nothing like his brother.

H. Lawrence&#x2019;s German wife and an Italian peasant, <i>Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover</i> follows the intense passions of Constance Chatterley. Trapped in an unhappy marriage to an aristocratic mine owner whose war wounds have left him paralyzed and impotent, Constance enters into a liaison with the gamekeeper Mellors. Frank Kermode called the book D. H. Lawrence&#x2019;s &#x201c;great achievement,&#x201d; Ana�s Nin described it as &#x201c;his best novel,&#x201d; and Archibald MacLeish hailed it as &#x201c;one of the most important works of fiction of the century.&#x201d; Along with an incisive Introduction by Kathryn Harrison, this Modern Library edition includes the transcript of the judge&#x2019;s decision in the famous 1959 obscenity trial that allowed <i>Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover</i> to be published in the United States.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous of Lawrence's novels, the 1928 <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> is no longer distinguished for the once-shockingly explicit treatment of its subject matter--the adulterous affair between a sexually unfulfilled upper-class married woman and the game keeper who works for the estate owned by her wheelchaired husband. Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote.

He has been a war correspondent, author and film-maker. He has twice won British journalism&#39;s highest award, that of Journalist of the Year, for his work all over the world, notably in Cambodia and Vietnam. He has been International Reporter of the Year and winner of the United Nations Associated Peace Prize and Gold Medal. For his broadcasting, he has won France&#39;s Reporter Sans Frontieres, an American television Academy Award, an Emmy, and the Richard Dimbleby Award, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. In 2003, he received the Sophie Prize for &#39;thirty years of exposing deception and improving human rights&#39;.A desanitized view of Australia from a veteran Australian journalist, ranging from its founding as a penal colony in 1788 to the machinations of the ``Old Mates,'' the powerful ``dullards'' who threaten the nation's hard-won status as a working-class society of equals. More than 160,000 came to Australia in chains, a practice continuing into the 1880's. Later generations tried to suppress their heritage, so Pilger had to do considerable work to unearth his great-great-grandmother, a pregnant 16-year-old Irish girl when she came over on one of the female slave ships. Such women were passed out first to ``officers, then to non-commissioned officers, then privates, and lastly such ex-convict settlers as seemed `respectable.''' Yet the offspring of convicts were more brutal still to Aborigines, taking them as slaves quite as in the American South. Aborigines were seen as animals; even into the 1950's babies were taken away at birth and ``adopted''; full rights are still not accorded these people. Meanwhile, Australia, with its whites-only immigration policy, remained aloof from its Asian neighbors. When the UK's influence waned, the US stepped in, most notably with the use of Australian conscripts in the Vietnam War. According to Pilger, the CIA actually undertook a sort of coup by poisoning the chances for reelection of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam through its influences with powerful Governor General John Kerr. One of the most extraordinary portraits here is of Kerr, a boilermakers's son and rabid conservative whose weakness was booze; he lost his job when he made a drunken pass at the Queen. A brooding, often angry book. Pilger sees hope for this nation of battlers in the example of New Zealand, a superficially similar country that noisily rejected the US nuclear umbrella and has turned fully ten percent of its land into a national park. A startling look, then, at a country quite different from, and hauntingly similar to, the US. (Forty photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Housing, breed selection, care, and feeding all require serious attention; this sort of access to specialized knowledge isn't so common these days.

In the 1930s, American Tijuana Bibles,&#x201d; little pornographic comic books that parodied popular comics and comic strips, were widely available. World War II gave a boost to erotic comics, especially illustrated pin-ups. This set the stage for men&#x2019;s magazines such as <i>Playboy</i>, which included racy cartoons from the beginning, and fetish comics. The flowering of the counterculture in the next decade gave rise to underground comics, whose acknowledged master was Robert Crumb. A parallel development occurred in Europe, where erotic comics like <i>Barbarella</i> were suddenly the rage. <i>Erotic Comics</i> tells this story with hundreds of illustrations, informative text, and insights from key artists, writers, and publishers. It&#x2019;s sexy, artistic, entertaining, intriguing, and informative.</p><p>Tim Pilcher is the coauthor of <i>The Essential Guide to World Comics</i> and <i>The Complete Cartooning Course</i>.

At first an isolated, exclusively Catholic operation offering a seven-year humanities program, the College failed to obtain a charter by the Massachusetts General Court until 1865. After 1900, Holy Cross became a four-year college in the American pattern and advanced to its present level by integrating important principles of Jesuit liberal arts education with the academic traditions of the strongest educational region in the nation.</p><p>Utilizing the universal Jesuit Plan of Studies, the college's leaders at first stressed connections with other Jesuit institutions in a program that emphasized classical languages, philosophy, history, mathematics, and natural sciences. About 1900, a second era began when the curriculum was altered to bring Holy Cross into conformity with the modern educational pattern: college offerings were amplified and the prep school was dropped. During the 1960s, a third era opened. It was characterized by coeducation, a more open curriculum, growing involvement of non-Jesuit faculty and administrators, the transition to a board of lay trustees, and rising academic standards as Holy Cross took its place as the foremost Jesuit school among four-year liberal arts colleges.</p><p><i>Thy Honored Name</i> highlights the confluence of two strong educational traditions&#x2015;Puritan and Jesuit&#x2015;and the growing appreciation of their compatibility. It is also an account of efforts to promote academic excellence without losing an authentically Jesuit identity in a region where many formerly religious schools have become secular. The book will hold interest for persons who study educational and religious history, for individuals interested in the development of New England and Worcester, and for friends of Holy Cross. </p><p>Anthony J. Kuzniewski, S.J., is professor of history and rector of the Jesuit Community at the College of the Holy Cross.</p><p>"Anthony Kuzniewski, SJ, professor of history in the College of Holy Cross, can tell a good story. Others have written histories of Holy Cross, but none has matched his literary skill and historical acumen. This is genuine history, not a celebratory essay. The author's thoroughness and attention to detail persuade one that no relevant document illuminating the college's history has been overlooked. . . . It is a handsome, almost flawless volume, that scholars and others interested in American higher education are sure to welcome."&#x2015;<i>Catholic Historical Review</i></p><p>"Kuzniewski has ultimately crafted an ample, widely encompassing institutional biography that is balanced, fair and interesting. An in so doing, he reminds us that an academic institution can achieve excellence and relevance even as it remains proud of its antique beginnings."&#x2015;<i>Connection</i></p><p></p></p><p>Kuzniewski is professor of history and rector of the Jesuit Community at the College of the Holy Cross.Thy Honored Name is deeply researched, well organized, attractively written, and judicious in interpretation. It is also critical in the sense of withholding nothing about crises of one sort or another in the story of Holy Cross. . . . -- <i>Philip Gleason, Professor Emeritus of History, University of Notre Dame</i></p><h2>Death of a Valentine (Hamish Macbeth Mystery)</h2><p>Amazing news has spread across the Scottish countryside. The most famous of highland bachelors, police sergeant Hamish Macbeth, will be married at last. Everyone in the village of Lochdubh adores Josie McSween, Macbeth's newest constable and blushing bride-to-be. <br><br>While locals think Josie is quite a catch, Hamish has a case of prenuptial jitters. After all, if it weren't for the recent murder of a beautiful woman in a neighbouring village, there wouldn't be a wedding at all. For it was a mysterious Valentine's Day package--delivered to the victim before her death--that initially drew Hamish and Josie together on the investigation. As they work side by side, Hamish and Josie soon discover that the woman's list of admirers was endless, confirming Hamish's suspicion that love can be blind, deaf . . . and deadly.</p><p>M.C. Beaton lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. In addition to the Hamish Macbeth series, she writes the Agatha Raisin mystery series.Fans will welcome the latest in the Hamish Macbeth mysteries, which opens to find him standing at the altar waiting miserably to be wed to his constable, Josie McSween, and praying to God that someone or something will intervene. Several murders have been solved earlier in the series, and between those crimes, taking care of his &#34;beasties,&#34; and the intrusion of Josie, Macbeth has had his hands full. Graeme Malcolm has a great way with the accents of Lochdubh, Scotland, and he has a wonderful vocal timbre. His timing is impeccable, especially when he delivers the many humorous moments that Beaton&#39;s series is known for. Listeners will be unable to keep from smiling as Macbeth endures one calamity after another.

According to most accounts, the Parkway was a New Deal "Godsend for the needy," built without conflict or opposition by landscape architects and planners who traced their vision along a scenic, isolated southern landscape. The historical archives relating to this massive public project, however, tell a different and much more complicated story, which Anne Mitchell Whisnant relates in this revealing history of the beloved roadway.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Super-Scenic Motorway</i> is a thoroughly researched, clear-eyed analysis of the genesis and development of the Blue Ridge Parkway.

She lives in Seattle.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>Slater Roxton was examining the strangely luminous paintings on the wall of the ornate burial chamber when the tomb trap was triggered.</p><p>Impending destruction was telegraphed in an ominous rumble and the aching groan of ancient machinery locked deep in the stone. His first thought was that the volcano that loomed over Fever Island was erupting. But one by one, massive sections of the ceiling of the passageway that led to the entrance of the temple complex slid open. Boulders rained down.</p><p>Brice Torrence&#x2019;s voice echoed from the far end of the corridor near the entrance.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Slater, get out of there. Hurry. Something terrible is happening.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Slater was already moving. He did not waste time collecting the lanterns, his sketches or the camera. He ran to the doorway of the chamber but when he looked into the long, twisting stone corridor that led to the entrance he saw at once that it was too late to escape.</p><p>More sections of the corridor ceiling slid open as he watched. Countless tons of the terrible hail crashed into the passage. The stones piled up rapidly, filling the tunnel. He knew that if he tried to make a dash to safety he would be crushed beneath the falling rocks. He had no choice but to turn back and retreat deeper into the unexplored maze of the tomb caverns.</p><p>He rushed across the chamber, grabbed the lanterns and headed into the nearest adjoining passage. The corridor twisted away into dense, unexplored night but no boulders rained down from above.</p><p>He ran a short distance into the passage and stopped, aware that if he went deeper he would soon get lost. He and Brice had not even begun to chart the complex of burial caves carved into the base of the volcano.</p><p>He hunkered down against one wall, bracing himself. The glary light of the lantern illuminated an eerie painting, a scene depicting an ancient, catastrophic eruption of a volcano. Destruction rained down on an elegant city built of white marble. It was, Slater thought, far too close to what was happening at that moment.</p><p>Clouds of dust wafted down the tunnel. He covered his mouth and nose with his shirt.</p><p>There was nothing for it but to wait for the thundering to stop. Dread swirled like acid through his veins. At any moment the ceiling of the cavern in which he was sheltering might give way, burying him in the rubble. At least it would all be over in seconds, he thought. He was not sure he wanted to contemplate his immediate future if he did survive. For whatever time he had left he would be trapped in a brilliantly engineered maze.</p><p>The storm of rock and stone seemed to go on forever. But eventually the temple caves fell silent. It was another eternity before the dust finally settled.</p><p>Warily, he got to his feet. He stood still for a moment, listening to the shattering silence, waiting for his pulse to calm. After a while he went to look out into the vaulted chamber in which he had been standing when the rock trap released its deadly cargo. Small stones littered the floor of the room but it appeared that they had bounced and rolled into the chamber from the massive heap that now sealed the passage that led back to the entrance.</p><p>He had survived, which meant that he was now entombed alive.</p><p>He began to calculate his odds in a surprisingly academic fashion. He concluded that he was still too shaken to absorb the enormity of his predicament.</p><p>There was no reason for Brice and the rest of the expedition team to believe that he had survived; nothing they could do to save him, even if they had some hope. Fever Island was an uninhabited chunk of volcanic rock covered in unexplored jungle. It was situated a few thousand miles from civilization.</p><p>The only resources available were limited to the supplies and equipment on board the ship anchored in the island&#x2019;s small, natural harbor. There was no way to acquire the machinery and the manpower required to remove the vast quantity of rock that clogged the temple entrance.</p><p>Brice would consult with the ship&#x2019;s captain, Slater thought. They would conclude that he was dead and they would pray that was true because there was nothing they could do to save him.</p><p>He put out one of the lanterns to conserve the fuel. Holding aloft the second lantern, he started walking into the maze. There were, he decided, only two possibilities. The first&#x2014;and most likely&#x2014;was that he would wander in the temple complex until he died. He could only hope that death would come before the never-ending darkness drove him mad.</p><p>The second possibility&#x2014;extremely remote&#x2014;was that he might blunder into a passage that would take him outside into the sunlight. But even if he was so fortunate it was unlikely that he would be able to find his way back to the ship before it sailed. They had been running low on supplies when they finally found the damned island after being thrown off course by a violent storm. The captain was convinced that another tempest was on the way. He would want to start the return trip to London as soon as possible. He had to think of his crew and the other men on the expedition.</p><p>Slater knew that if he managed to escape the maze he would find himself stranded on an island that was not a regular port of call for any known vessel. It could be years before another ship arrived, if ever.</p><p>He walked on into the night-bound caverns, his only guide the temple paintings left behind by the artists of an ancient civilization that had long ago been buried beneath rivers of molten lava.</p><p>He did not know exactly when he began to understand the meaning of the paintings, if, indeed, he actually did perceive the intent of the stories. He reminded himself that there was a very good possibility that he was already slipping into madness. The eternal darkness and the mesmerizing artwork were disorienting. A man in his situation could easily begin to hallucinate.</p><p>But eventually he thought he detected three distinct legends. He stopped when it dawned on him that each tale was a different path into the maze. One series of paintings depicted a tale of war. The second was a story of vengeance.</p><p>In the end he chose the third legend.</p><p>He never knew how long he walked or how far. At times he stopped, exhausted, and sank into a slumber that was splintered with images from the wall paintings that were his only guide. Occasionally he stumbled across small underground streams. He stopped to drink deeply from them. He tried to make the cheese and bread in his pack last but eventually they were gone.</p><p>He kept walking because there was nothing else to do. To stop would be an act of total surrender.</p><p>In the end when he staggered out of the caverns into a stone circle illuminated with daylight he almost continued walking because he was certain that he was hallucinating.</p><p><i>Sunlight.</i></p><p>Some part of his mind registered the reality of what he was seeing.</p><p>In disbelief he looked up and saw that the hot, tropical sunshine was slanting through an opening in the rocks. A series of steep stone steps had been cut into the rock. A long black cord dangled from the opening.</p><p>Calling on the last of his reserves, he grasped the rope and tested it to make certain it would hold his weight. When he was satisfied that it was secure he started up the ancient staircase, using the rope as a handrail.</p><p>He reached the opening, scrambled out of the temple caves and collapsed on the stone floor of an open-air temple. He had been so long in the shadows that he had to close his eyes against the brilliant sunlight.</p><p>Somewhere nearby a gong boomed. The sound echoed endlessly through the jungle.</p><p>He was not alone on the island.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>A YEAR LATER another ship dropped anchor in the small harbor. Slater was on board when it sailed. But he was not the same man that he had been when he arrived on Fever Island.</p><p>Over the course of the next several years he became a legend in certain circles. When he finally returned to London he discovered the great curse that befalls all legends: There is no place to call home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ONE</p><p>I can&#x2019;t believe Anne is gone.&#x201d; Matty Bingham blotted her eyes with a handkerchief. &#x201c;She was always so spirited. So charming. So full of life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she was.&#x201d; Ursula Kern tightened her grip on the umbrella and watched the gravediggers dump great clods of earth on the coffin. &#x201c;She was a woman of the modern age.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And an excellent secretary.&#x201d; Matty tucked her handkerchief into her satchel. &#x201c;A credit to the agency.&#x201d;</p><p>Matty was in her mid-thirties, a spinster without family or connections. Like the other women who came to work at the Kern Secretarial Agency, she had abandoned any hope of marriage and a family of her own. Like Anne and the others, she had seized the promise that Ursula offered&#x2014;a respectable career as a professional secretary, a field that was finally opening up to women.</p><p>The day was appropriately funereal in tone&#x2014;a depressing shade of gray with a steady drizzle of rain. Ursula and Matty were the only mourners present at the graveside. Anne had died alone. No family had come forward to claim the body. Ursula had paid for the funeral. It was, she thought, not just her responsibility as Anne&#x2019;s employer and sole heir, but also a final act of friendship.</p><p>A great emptiness welled up inside her. Anne Clifton had been her closest friend for the past two years. They had bonded over the things they had in common&#x2014;a lack of family and haunting pasts that they had very carefully buried.</p><p>Anne might have possessed a few faults&#x2014;some of the other secretaries at the agency had considered her a fast woman&#x2014;but Ursula knew there had always been a distinct twist of admiration in the remarks. Anne&#x2019;s bold determination to carve her own path in life against all odds made her the very model of the Modern Woman.</p><p>When the coffin vanished beneath the growing mound of dirt, Ursula and Matty turned and walked back across the cemetery.</p><p>&#x201c;It was kind of you to pay for Anne&#x2019;s funeral,&#x201d; Matty said.</p><p>Ursula went through the wrought-iron gates. &#x201c;It was the least I could do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will miss her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So will I,&#x201d; Ursula said.</p><p><i>Who will pay for my funeral when the time comes?</i> she wondered.</p><p>&#x201c;Anne did not seem like the type to take her own life,&#x201d; Matty said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, she did not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>URSULA DINED IN SOLITUDE, as she usually did. When the meal was concluded she went into her small, cozy study.</p><p>The housekeeper bustled into the room to light the fire.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs. Dunstan,&#x201d; Ursula said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re certain you&#x2019;re all right, then?&#x201d; Mrs. Dunstan asked gently. &#x201c;I know you considered Miss Clifton a friend. Hard to lose a connection of that sort. Lost a few friends, myself, over the years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite all right,&#x201d; Ursula said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to sort through Miss Clifton&#x2019;s things and make an inventory. Then I&#x2019;ll go to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Dunstan went quietly out into the hall and closed the door. Ursula waited a moment and then she poured herself a stiff shot of brandy. The fiery spirits took off some of the chill she had been feeling since Anne&#x2019;s death.</p><p>After a while she crossed the room to the trunk that held Anne&#x2019;s things.</p><p>One by one she removed the items that had aroused in her a deep sense of unease&#x2014;an empty perfume bottle, a small velvet bag containing a few pieces of jewelry, Anne&#x2019;s stenography notebook and two packets of seeds. Taken individually, each was easily explained. But as a group they raised disturbing questions.</p><p>Three days earlier, when Anne&#x2019;s housekeeper had discovered the body of her employer, she had immediately sent for Ursula. There had been no one else to summon. Initially, Ursula had been unable to accept the notion that Anne had either died of natural causes or taken her own life. She had called in the police. They had immediately concluded that there was no sign of foul play.</p><p>But Anne had left a note. Ursula had found it crumpled on the floor beside the body. To most people the marks made in pencil would have looked like random scribbles. Anne, however, was a skilled stenographer who had been trained in the Pitman method. As was the case with many professional secretaries, she had gone on to develop her own personal version of coded writing.</p><p>The note was a message, and Ursula knew it had been intended for her. Anne had been well aware that no one else could decipher her unique stenography.</p><p>Behind water closet.</p><p>Ursula sat down at her desk and drank a little more brandy while she contemplated the items. After a while, she pushed the empty perfume bottle aside. She had found it on Anne&#x2019;s little writing desk, not with the other things. It was unlike Anne not to have mentioned the purchase of new perfume but aside from that there did not appear to be anything mysterious about it.</p><p>The notebook, the jewelry pouch and the seeds, however, were a very different matter. Why had Anne hidden all three items behind the water closet?</p><p>After a while she opened the stenography notebook and began to read. Transcribing Anne&#x2019;s cryptic shorthand was slow-going but two hours later she knew that she had been wrong about one thing that afternoon. Paying for the funeral was not to be her last act of friendship.</p><p>There was one more thing she could do for Anne&#x2014;find her killer.</p></p><h2>Wonder Woman &amp; the Justice League America Vol. 2</h2><p>Comics writers Mark Waid and Dan Vado are joined by Marc Campos and a team of veteran artists as they present one of the most action-packed stories in Justice League history with WONDER WOMAN &amp; JUSTICE LEAGUE AMERICA VOL. 2.<br> &nbsp;<br> With Wonder Woman leading the Justice League America, the team has had to battle enemies from within and outside threats too big for any one hero.

There is little consensus about how and what we should produce and consume. It is not even clear what food is or whether people have similar experiences of it. On one hand, food is recognized as a basic need, if not a basic right. On the other hand, it is hard to generalize about it given the wide range of practices and cuisines, and the even wider range of tastes.<br><br>This book is an introduction to the philosophical dimensions of food. David M. Kaplan examines the nature and meaning of food, how we experience it, the social role it plays, its moral and political dimensions, and how we judge it to be delicious or awful. He shows how the different branches of philosophy contribute to a broader understanding of food: what food is (metaphysics), how we experience food (epistemology), what taste in food is (aesthetics), how we should make and eat food (ethics), how governments should regulate food (political philosophy), and why food matters to us (existentialism). Kaplan embarks on a series of philosophical investigations, considering topics such as culinary identity and authenticity, tasting and food criticism, appetite and disgust, meat eating and techno-foods, and consumerism and conformity. He emphasizes how different narratives help us navigate the complex world of food and reminds us we all have responsibilities to ourselves, to others, and to animals. An original treatment of a timely subject, <i>Food Philosophy</i> is suitable for undergraduates while making a significant contribution to scholarly debates.</p><p>David M. Kaplan is associate professor of philosophy at the University of North Texas, where he also directs the Philosophy of Food Project. He is editor of <i>The Philosophy of Food</i> (2012) and the <i>Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics</i>, 2nd ed. (2019), among other works.Kaplan's excellent book integrates issues of food and eating with philosophy, enlivening the field and deepening the ways we should think and theorize about food. He blends insightful analysis with empirical studies, bringing together much of the literature on food into a seamless study that is original, thought-provoking, and readable. (Carolyn Korsmeyer, author of <i>Things: In Touch with the Past</i>)<br><br>David M. Kaplan has thought deeply about food, and <i>Food Philosophy</i> has countless interesting and instructive observations, theories, and insights about food and eating. It is full of gems that I want to draw on in my own work. (Anne Barnhill, coeditor of <i>The Oxford Handbook of Food Ethics</i>)<br><br>This is exactly the book I have been waiting for as a sociologist interested in philosophical questions opened up by food in our times. It is an inviting introduction to central questions of ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology for philosophers, social scientists, and humanists.

The&nbsp;Crossway Classic Commentaries series, carefully adapted for maximum understanding and usefulness, presents the very best work on individual Bible books for today's believers.</p> <p>The author of Hebrews wanted his audience to know and understand one truth: Christ is superior, and therefore, so is Christianity. He demonstrates this by comparing the imperfect old covenant with the perfect new covenant. The person of Christ is better than prophets and angels, His priesthood is greater than that of Melchizedek and the line of Aaron, and His power within the believer's life is incomparable. Between these contrasts he exhorts the readers to persevere in their faith, be obedient, grow in their understanding, and not miss the grace of God. The lessons and admonitions of Hebrews have intensely practical application for all readers&#x2014;then and now.</p> <p>John Owens' unveiling of this text will give pastors and students of the Bible a thorough handle on its key passages. The message of Hebrews proves that Jesus Christ is still the Savior the world needs today. Contemporary believers will be inspired by it as they seek to uphold and defend Christ's supremacy in a pluralistic world.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Owen</strong>&nbsp;(1616&#x2013;1683) was vice chancellor of Oxford University and served as advisor and chaplain to Oliver Cromwell.

Set in 1350 BC, the legend of Akhnaton tells of the Pharoah&#39;s attempt to convince his nation to abandon their old &#39;pagan&#39; god Amon and to turn to the worship of a new deity, the monotheistic sun god, Aton. Introduced to the legend by Howard Carter, discoverer of Tutankhamun&#39;s tomb, when she met him in Luxor in 1931, Agatha Christie became fascinated by both the story and the society in which it took place. Her painstaking researches led to this retelling of the story in the form of a highly readable and dramatic two-hour play. Akhnaton was written by Agatha Christie in 1937, when her interest in Egyptology from her travels with her archaeologist husband was at its height. Probably her most serious play, it was deemed too ambitious to be performed, and it went unknown and unpublished until Collins released a hardback edition in 1973. Never paperbacked or published subsequently, this rare edition has become the Holy Grail for Agatha Christie collectors, keen to learn more about this unique drama and to discover its relevance alongside her other Egyptian books such as Death Comes As the End, Death on the Nile, Appointment With Death and Come, Tell Me How You Live. Now this facsimile edition of the original hardback at last gives Christie fans the chance to discover for themselves one of Agatha Christie&#39;s most highly sought after and exotic creations.</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 100 foreign countries. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 20 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.&#39;Agatha&#39;s most beautiful and profound play, brilliant in its delineation of character, tense with drama. The treatment comes as near to historical plausibility as any play about the past can be. The Egyptian court life and the vagaries of Egyptian religion come alive. The characters themselves are here submitted to exceptionally penetrating analytical treatment, because they are not merely subservient to the denouement of a murder plot, but each one is a prime agent in the development of a real historical drama.&#39; MAX MALLOWAN &#39;Akhnaton is a drama of ruthless logic and theatrical power. It deals in a complex way with a number of issues: the difference between superstition and reverence, the danger of rash iconoclasm, the value of the arts, the nature of love, the conflicts set up by the concept of loyalty, and the tragedy apparently inherent in the inevitability of change. A fascinating play.&#39; CHARLES OSBORNE</p><h2>Walking with Nanak</h2><p><p>Haroon Khalid&#x2019;s lifelong fascination with Guru Nanak was reignited when he came upon Baburbani, a poem written by the saint. This and the discovery that Guru Nanak spent a large part of his life in Pakistan, inspired Khalid to undertake a journey that he hoped would help him learn more about the revered founder of Sikhism.</p> <p>In this wonderful paean to Guru Nanak, Khalid describes his travels across the length and breadth of Pakistan as he visits the many (No Suggestions) and other locales associated with the saint, delving into their history and musing about their place and significance in a Muslim country. But this book is not merely a story about (No Suggestions), it is also a re-telling of the story of Nanak the son, the poet, the wanderer, the father, the friend. Sifting through the stories of his miracles and poetry, we emerge with a picture of Nanak, the man.</p> <p>Also exploring the histories of all the subsequent Gurus after Nanak, the book traces the story of how an unorganized spiritual movement evolved into the institutionalized Khalsa of Guru Gobind Singh. Through the journeys of all the Gurus, the book describes how Nanak the poet became Guru Nanak the saint.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Aesop for Children</h2><p>A collection of animal stories that teach lessons about kindness, persuasion, boastfulness, flattery, common sense, revenge, honesty, and curiosity</p><p>A Collection of Fables from Aesop with the moral at the end of each story.

He lives with his wife, Helen, in upstate New York.</p>PreS Up The anecdotes associated with Texas' fabled cowboy hero burst from the pages in rapid succession, Kellogg's robust illustrations enlarging and enriching the choppy, energetic text that is seasoned with Texan expressions. In dramatizing Pecos Bill's life story, Kellogg also conveys a sense of place, of the rugged, expansive physical beauty of the American West in pioneer days. Yellow-oranges and blues dominate the scenes, in tones that range from dust-pale to midnight blue. Skillful framing and alternating of perspectives enhance readers' involvement: vast panoramas in which people are dwarfed by endless stretches of land and sky; double-page spreads cluttered with close-up action; breathtaking overviews, as of a tremendous herd of cattle, each steer made distinct, yet part of a near-monochromatic blend of hazy light and animal landscape. In contrast to these lavish illustrations are neatly-boxed illustrations that parallel the text, sometimes spilling from the frames when the action simply can't be contained. Kellogg's style is ideally suited to this tall taleantic, detailed, colorful, hyperbolic.

Inwood, a principal lecturer in history at Englands Thames Valley University, begins his economic and social history with Londons founding as an outpost of the Roman Empire and continues to the present. He is chiefly concerned with where and how Londoners worked and led their daily lives. Ideally situated geographically, London has always been most important as a center of trade and commerce. It has also served as a social, cultural, religious, and intellectual center, providing its citizens with stimulation that could be found nowhere else in the British realm. The author's main focus is on the various trades, professions, and social groups, their interactions with one another, the Crown, and the local government as embodied in the city's aldermen and lord mayor. London's frequent transformations in building and design have been due chiefly to the devastating fires that have wreaked temporary havoc on its landscape. Key to the citys eminence, as well as to its steady population growth through WWII, has been the large numbers of foreigners who made it cosmopolitan even in the Middle Ages. Although London's significance to Britains history cannot be overstated, Inwood tends to understate it by losing sight of the context in which London's history has occurred. This shortcoming makes the book a hard read. Better maps would have made the overwhelming detail more intelligible, and a summing up at the end of chapters or sections would have helped give relevance to the multitudinous facts. In all, though, Inwood makes use of the most recent material available, including new archaeological finds, and gives us a reliable sourcebook to which we can turn with confidence when needed.

Computers put men out of work; pushing a single button is enough to start a nuclear war. <br>Gradually, though, the world has begun to remember that it is man for whom the machines must work, and not the other way around. We recognize now that science, for all its achievements, has done little to help us understand ourselves or realize our potential. <br>There is no sense in waiting for science to do it for us. Each of us must now take it upon himself to understand his true nature and strength. The Chinese classic "Saikontan" says that we stand like beggars at the gate, forgetting the infinite power given us by the universe. Instead of shrinking from this potential, we should be thankful for it. we should strive to manifest it and help others to do the same. <br>The author regards his Four Basic Principles to Unify Mind and Body as having been given to him by the universe to spread the way of the universe. There have been many who have grasped unification of mind and body. Very few, however, could teach it. Fewer still could teach how to teach it.

Follow him on twitter @JezAlborough.Like its predecessors Where's My Teddy? and It's the Bear!, this large-size book about Eddie and his teddy bear, Freddie, will endear itself to pint-size preschoolers. When Eddie wishes for a friend to talk to, he and Freddie encounter the forest bear's huge, golden teddy bear, followed shortly by the enormous, brown bear himself. "Oh, teddy [says the bear, whimpering], what can I do?/ I've got no friends, apart from you." Eddie, hiding behind the bear's teddy, "speaks" for the teddy and laughs when the bear falls for his ventriloquism. Soon, Eddie and the forest bear are giggling together, providing the voices for their teddies and making plans to play together again. "Do you think that they're lonely?/ Not anymore..../ That's what having friends is for." The plot and the message are pat and the illustrations can be repetitious?nonetheless, what prevails is the author's expert understanding of just what preschoolers find amusing. For example, at the moment of confrontation, as Eddie and the forest bear stare at each other, clinging desperately to their teddies, the bear stands like a pigeon-toed toddler sucking on his huge thumb. Young readers will laugh when the bear believes his teddy is actually talking, partly because they will delight in their own superior knowledge but also because the bruin is plainly "such a great big silly bear!"

Margaret Wheatley called for free-flowing information, individual empowerment, relationship networks, and organizational change that evolves organically -- ideas that have become commonplace. This new edition includes a new chapter that examines the relationship of change to identity.</p><p>When Margaret J. Wheatley's <i>Leadership and the New Science</i> was initially published in 1992, it outlined an unquestionably unique but extremely challenging view of change, leadership, and the structure of groups. Many readers immediately embraced its cutting-edge perspective, but others just could not understand how the complicated scientific tenets it described could be used to reshape institutions. Now Wheatley, an organizational specialist who has since coauthored <i>A Simpler Way</i>, updates the original by including additional material (such as an epilogue addressing her personal experiences during the past decade) and reconstructing some of her more challenging concepts. The result is a much clearer work that first explores the implications of quantum physics on organizational practice, then investigates ways that biology and chemistry affect living systems, and finally focuses on chaos theory, the creation of a new order, and the manner that scientific principles affect leadership. "Our old ways of relating to each other don't support us any longer," she writes. "It is up to us to journey forth in search of new practices and new ideas that will enable us to create lives and organizations worthy of human habitation." <i>--Howard Rothman</i>IN HER PIONEERING BESTSELLER Leadership and the New Science, Margaret Wheatley showed how the "New Science"&#x2014;revolutionary discoveries in quantum physics, chaos theory, and biology that are overturning centuries-old images of the universe&#x2014;provides powerful insights into the design, leadership, and management of organizations. Now, in a completely revised and expanded edition, Wheatley uses her past seven years&#x2019; experience putting these ideas to use in a wide array of organizations all over the world to shed new light on issues crucial to organizing work, people, and life, including: <br>o How do systems move from chaos to order? <br>o How is order different from control? <br>o How can we reconcile individual autonomy and organizational order? <br>o How can we create more participative, open, and adaptive organizations? <br>o What are the keys to organizational growth, learning, and communication? <p>This revised edition is written in even more accessible language and adds an entirely new chapter to this now classic book. In "Change&#x2014;The Capacity of Life," Wheatley explains how the new physics offers an entirely new understanding of change, in which change happens at the level of identity rather than by isolating and changing one defective part of ourselves or our organizations. </p><p>In a new epilogue, Wheatley adds a personal chronicle of her experiences since the publication of the first edition. She tells about the shift in her own understanding that occurred as she came to realize that Leadership and the New Science not only presents an alternative view of organizational dynamics but challenges people&#x2019;s most fundamental beliefs about the way the world works. </p><p>Like the first edition, the book includes a special section of color photographs of beautiful patterns and processes&#x2014;including fractals, strange attractors, and chemical clocks&#x2014;that take readers on a mind-opening journey into the heart of the new science.</p></p><h2>The War for Late Night: When Leno Went Early and Television Went Crazy</h2><p><b>A dramatic account of the politics and personalities behind NBC's calamitous attempt to reinvent late-night television. </b> <br><br> When NBC decided to move Jay Leno into prime time to make room for Conan O'Brien to host the <i>Tonight</i> show-a job he had been promised five years earlier-skeptics anticipated a train wreck for the ages. It took, in fact, only a few months for the dire predictions to come true. Leno's show, panned by critics, dragged down the ratings-and the profits-of NBC's affiliates, while ratings for Conan's new <i>Tonight</i> show plummeted to the lowest levels in history.

After completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia University, he worked for two New York newspapers. He returned to Italy in 1930 to become a correspondent for <i>Corriere della Sera.</i> In 1940 he was confined by the Fascists. With the Allied liberation he returned to publishing and founded <i>Il Globo.</i> Subsequently he served as the chief editor of several newspapers and magazines. His books include <i>Americans Are Alone in the World</i> (1958), <i>From Caesar to the Mafia</i> (1971), and <i>Peking to Paris</i> (1973). He died in 1984.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><i>THE PEACEFUL INVASION</i><br><br>Italians are pleased and perplexed. Every year since the end of the war they have seen the number of foreign visitors to their country increase at an incredibly rapid rate. The phenomenon has now reached unprecedented, practically inexplicable, and almost alarming proportions. In the 1950s the tourists numbered eight, ten, twelve million yearly. A little later, only yesterday, they were fifteen, seventeen, nineteen million. They have now passed the twenty million mark, a proportion of more than one tourist to every two and a half Italians, and the total is still growing. It appears that, if circumstances remain favourable, the travellers will reach thirty million within a decade, and will eventually match and even surpass the number of native inhabitants in the peninsula. Nothing daunts foreigners. Nothing frightens them. Nothing stops them. They arrive in a steady stream, by all forms of transport and even on foot, by day and night, from the sea or via the Alps. What is but a small trickle in the winter months grows in the spring to the size of a stream, and, in April, May, and June, turns into a monsoon flood, breaking all dikes, covering everything in sight. It begins to recede in September. It never completely dries up.<br><br>People come from all parts of the five known continents, from the old established nations of Europe and America and from the newly founded ones in Africa and Asia. The largest number come from the north, the vast, democratic, bourgeois, industrial north of Europe and America. Some now also come from Russia, in some ways the most northerly of all countries, organized parties of sightseers, behaving like military units traversing a dangerous territory inhabited by treacherous natives, as diffident and self-contained as Xenophon's Greeks marching across Asia Minor. Russian tourists all wear the same box-like clothes, as new as those of provincial newly-weds, and ankle-length raincoats. They look well-fed, self-satisfied, and well-behaved. They appear eager to acquire as much culture, in all its forms, as rapidly and cheaply as possible. They have a disturbing resemblance to the diligent German tourists at the beginning of the century, the solid subjects of William II.<br><br>There are many travellers who, in order to obey the urge that drives them south, abandon their own countries, whose delights and tourist attractions are being advertised and celebrated all over the world. What do they seek that is better than what they left behind? Not many Italians willingly travel abroad in any direction, north, south, east or west. They always feel more or less exiled and unhappy in alien lands, and honestly believe the attractions of their homeland to be most satisfying. They are the first victims of the famous charm of Italy, never satiated with her sights, climate, food, music and life. Familiarity never breeds contempt in them. Neapolitans, for instance, after many thousand years, still gaze with the same rapture on their native landscape, eat <i>spaghetti alle vongole</i> as if they had never tasted them before, and compose endless songs dedicated to the immortal beauty of their women and their bay. Those Italians who travel abroad are, as a rule, the privileged -- Milanese industrialists and Roman princes who have adopted foreign ways, cabinet ministers, diplomats, newly-weds -- and the disinherited who go looking for work. They are usually all equally homesick abroad; the rich and the poor look for <i>caff� espresso,</i> a good Italian restaurant, wherever they go, and sigh for the day of their return.<br><br>At the high tide of the tourist season, from early June till late September, visitors fill every empty space available in Italy. Trains, buses, boats, restaurants, churches, museums, Greek and Roman ruins, chapels, concert halls, historic landmarks, and famous belvederes, whence romantic landscapes (two stars in the guide books) can be admired, are packed to capacity with foreigners. One literally finds them everywhere, often at one's table, unknown friends of friends, sometimes even in one's bathroom and bed. They also fill a couple of universities, Perugia and Urbino, set aside for them, where they study the language, imbibe the Latin sun-drenched culture, make love, go swimming, and feed themselves cheaply on pasta, olive oil, tomatoes, and garlic. American universities sometimes hold summer sessions, in art appreciation, history of civilization, and related subjects, in some ancient villa on a hill-top near Florence with a view over the whole city, or a <i>palazzo</i> on the Grand Canal. Swedish and Norwegian workers' clubs have purchased wooded strips of deserted Italian coastline, where they have built their own club-houses and recreation centres.<br><br>There are sultry days in July and August when the cities, emptied by the natives, are almost completely taken over by the swarms of dusty and perspiring foreigners. During the siesta hour, when even the carriage horses sleep under their straw hats, the relentless tourists finally slow down. They bivouac everywhere. They recline on park benches, kerbstones, the stone brims of fountains, or ancient ruins. They place their heads over their crossed arms on caf� tables for a siesta among the empty bottles, the dirty napkins, and the recently purchased souvenirs. They then really look like a tired and bedraggled army after a fatiguing battle, who have occupied a city abandoned by their fleeing enemy. They have conquered. The place is theirs.<br><br>I am not talking here of the minority, the experienced foreigners who know why they come to Italy and what Italy is. Many have come here before and know their way about, others have never been here but somehow know what to do and what they want. They all avoid the heat and the dust, seldom visit the obvious places but, when they have to (the obvious places are often the most desirable), they go at convenient hours, when the crowd is away and the air is cool. They wear ordinary clothes, the same as everybody else. Some are in love with nature, others with art, culture, archaeology, or music. Some like meeting people and making friends, others discover little-known beaches or unexplored islands. There are those who make lengthy detours, to see some little-known masterpiece, and those who like food and wine and know the <i>trattorie</i> which only few natives and no foreigners have yet discovered. There are many who speak the language well. These easily disappear in the background. They do not interest me here. There is nothing peculiar about them. I am talking of the vast majority of tourists, the millions driven by some unknown urge.<br><br>They are so punctual and numerous that their mass arrival, in the eyes of ordinary Italians, appears as irresistible as a natural event, as ineluctable as the seasonal return of migratory birds, swallows, quails, or partridges, driven by instinct; or as an anthropological phenomenon like the migration of nomadic tribes seeking green pastures for their herds. The impression is heightened by the fact that many of these travellers look somewhat alike to Italian eyes. They dress in garishly-coloured clothes, much as the members of the ancient barbaric hordes once did and as the Gipsies and Berbers still do. A great number of Germans, Scandinavians, Britons, and Dutch have pink skins, which the sun seldom succeeds in tanning a decent brown but reddens to the tender colour of <i>prosciutto</i> or covers with freckles. They perspire freely in the heat, under their nylon shirts. They wear barbaric sandals. They have dark glasses over their eyes and their heads are bare or covered with cheap straw hats on whose brims are printed or embroidered the names of cities, sanctuaries, beaches, islands, or other famous landmarks.<br><br>There is something mysteriously significant about the behaviour of many of them. A mild frenzy takes most of them and transforms them once across the Italian border. It resembles the irresistible excitement which captures some living organisms and makes them forget themselves and everything else, when, like salmon going upstream, they obey some deep and secret impulse of Nature; or the intoxication, the gentle and sweet delirium, which makes all honeymooners quietly mad everywhere in the world and honeymooners in Italy doubly so, both because they are on their honeymoon and they are in Italy. Like all newly-weds, in fact, many ordinary travellers seem deliciously drunk with new illusions and hopes. The sedate professional man, the sober shopkeeper, the loyal employee, the rigorous scientist, the stern educator, the tidy housewife, the bespectacled spinster, the innocent maiden, the virtuous wife, the resigned husband, all behave as they probably never dared to behave before and as they probably would not behave publicly in their native habitat. More exactly, they behave as if they had shed the r�les assigned to them and the personalities bestowed on them by Nature, because such r�les and personalities had suddenly become repugnant and alien to them; or as if all the rules of the game of life had been changed or suspended. Some seem strangely deprived of all, or part of, their customary discernment, of their powers of control and discrimination, and of the scepticism, diffidence, prudence, suspicion, and fear necessary for survival in most countries. They get into all sorts of scrapes. They make friends with all sorts of people. They look at all things with indulgent and dewy eyes, apparently ready to love, admire, understand, or, at least, excuse and forgive almost everything, the good, the bad, the indifferent, the repugnant. They are often easily swindled, but many do not always mind if they are.<br><br>Most of these visitors from Northern Europe drink vast and indiscriminate quantities of wine. They drink, with equal good-natured enthusiasm, anything at all: costly vintages from famous vineyards, raw wines still smelling of sulphur and wooden staves, sweet and syrupy wines made for people who know little about such things. It is, for some curious reason, the first thing Germans and Austrians do, as soon as they cross the Brenner pass on their southward trip. They stop the car at one of the many wineshops which line both sides of the valley road, just beyond the border, as frequent as the petrol stations. Each <i>osteria</i> has a wrought-iron hanging sign, a terrace in the quivering shadow of a leafy pergola, checked table-cloths, waitresses in <i>dirndl,</i> everything designed in a tasteful fairy-story style, a style which is a mixture suited to the geographical and psychological spot, half German and half Italian, half Walt-Disney-Tyrolean and half <i>Il Trovatore</i> or Palio-di-Siena-Medieval. On the Brenner road, German and Austrian tourists behave as the Americans did under prohibition, when they rushed for the first bar across the Canadian border. There is no obvious explanation for this phenomenon. There is no scarcity of cheap wines, local or imported, in Germany and Austria. Perhaps these people are trying to quench not a physiological but a psychological thirst. This may be an unconscious magic rite; they drink wine as if it were a potion necessary to acquire a new personality, or they drink it as one drinks champagne on New Year's eve, on the stroke of midnight, to celebrate the crossing of a spiritual border and to inaugurate new hopes and a new life.<br><br>With equal indulgent enthusiasm, these summer visitors indiscriminately enjoy all kinds of doubtful attractions, things they probably shunned at home. They listen with the same breathless rapture and delighted smiles to the best opera singing in the world at Rome, Milan, or Spoleto, and to wheezy village bands, to impeccable Vivaldi quartets and to tinny dance orchestras. They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes, mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes, or fisherman's octopus and shrimps, fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach. They buy vast quantities of souvenirs to take home, smart things they cannot find elsewhere, cheap trinkets made in Japan, costly masterpieces, tawdry imitations.<br><br>Many try to speak Italian. A few creditably manage this in a short time. Others think they do. Things seem, of course, more significant and enjoyable when expressed in the native language. A spade is only a spade, a <i>Shaufel</i> but a <i>Shaufel,</i> but a <i>badile</i> cannot help being a pagan, Mediteranean, intoxicating <i>badile.</i> Some study lists of words phonetically spelled in handbooks. Some pick them up in random conversations. They also try hard to gesticulate wildly as they speak. They usually manage it in the style of amateur comedians playing an Italian character. They laugh loudly and converse with everybody, the people at the next table, travelling companions in the trains, the waiters, the beggars, the street singers, the cicerones, anybody in sight, with the same good-natured lack of discrimination with which dog lovers pet any dog.<br><br>The men, many men at least, those of all ages who have a natural bent for that sort of thing, admire and pursue Italian girls. It must be said that the Italian girls and young women, for reasons nobody knows for sure, are now more disturbingly beautiful than they have ever been in men's memory and perhaps in history, certainly more attractive and desirable than the models of the most famous statues and paintings in the past; Botticelli's 'Venus', Titian's 'Sacred Love', and Raphael's 'Fornarina' would not make anybody turn around in the streets. Italian girls are more attractive, and approachable, not only than in the past but also than in many other countries today. Feminine beauty, before the war, like prosperity, seemed to be a privilege reserved to rare local cases, but widespread among many foreigners, especially Americans. Smart Italian young men of the time anxiously awaited the disembarking of the American girls in the spring, well-shaped, well-washed, well-dressed, and incredibly long-legged, who always looked as if they really arrived from another and younger world. They were healthy, witty, free, and unafraid. Now our women, too, have somehow surprisingly acquired long and shapely legs; they have lovely and pert faces, overbearing breasts, thin waists, and harmonious behinds like double mandolins. But, more than this, they have simple, unembarrassed, friendly manners: they can say tender words with heart-breaking candour or, at times, prettily pronounce unprintable ones.<br><br>Foreign men, it is true, have always pursued women in Italy. The courtesans of Venice and Rome during the Renaissance were much appreciated. The Carnival season in Rome and Venice was for centuries merely an excuse to chase masked girls through the streets. Now the hunt has acquired a more determined, almost desperate, character. Many visitors are fascinated by the girls to the point that they often lose all powers of coherent speech and judgment: they are bewitched by the girls' sinuous and provocative walk, their inviting and hospitable ways, their smart clothes which often look as if they are sewn on them, or, more especially, their tiny two-piece bathing suits. Foreign men sometimes follow some specially provocative specimens in the street like hungry dogs following butcher boys delivering meat. Striking up an acquaintance is not always difficult, in a <i>caff�</i> or on the beach. Many men easily, too easily perhaps, find their way to some girl's bedroom. Some of these always fall deeply in love. They earnestly want to get married. They want to bring back a living souvenir of the land of sunshine and amiable ways to their gloomy countries. At the end of every summer, there are men who threaten suicide (a few kill themselves), for the love of a beautiful woman, wit...</p><h2>Gourd Crafts: 20 Great Projects to Dye, Paint, Cut, Carve, Bead and Woodburn in a Weekend (The Weekend Crafter)</h2><p>A guide to using the Cucurbita and Lagenaria siceraria (a sort of hard shelled pumpkin), for a range of decorative uses in the home and in the garden.

This book also collects the &#34;All the Damned Souls at Sea&#34; Kane comic by Scott Allie, Guy Davis, and Dave Stewart.</p><p><b>Scott Allie </b>is a comic writer, editor, and former editor in chief of Dark Horse Comics.

In loving detail, the Dutch-born artist (who lives in Paris) describes the process of transformation, providing labeled pictures of tools, maps of the proposed new arrangement, and a yearlong narrative of tasks done, planting and harvest, people who come to help, and the many pleasures and uses of the ever-changing space. Meanwhile, the children make friends with Luke, a wheelchair-bound boy whose balcony garden overlooks theirs; he enjoys offering advice about the activities he watches below. In the spirit of Christina Bjork's Linnea's Almanac (1989), much information is conveyed through these lively characters, with the emphasis on their activities rather than on the minimal story. Adding to the appeal are the book's large scale and the charming illustrations of the thriving garden and the city's nearby bustle, in a style reminiscent of Satomi Ichikawa's art. The city looks French, but the many plants shown are also found in the US. A lovely book sure to generate enthusiasm for its subject.

He helps men to understand not only how to respond to a woman's feelings, but also how to make her feel important. Using humorous and touching illustrations from his own life, as well as case histories and biblical examples, Gary Smalley maps a blueprint to a better marriage.</p></p><p><p>Gary Smalley was one of the country's best-known authors and speakers on family relationships. He was the award-winning, best-selling author or coauthor of sixteen books, as well as several popular films and videos. <em>The Blessing</em> and <em>The Two Sides of Love</em> have won Gold Medallions, <em>The Language of Love</em> won the Angel Award as the best contribution to family life, and his other titles have received Silver Medallions. His national infomercial Hidden Keys to Loving Relationships has been viewed by television audiences all over the world.</p>If Only I Knew Before I approached Gary about writing a "marriage book for men," I knew his material was good, but I had no idea how meaningful it would be to me personally. After all, I had been married for almost ten years and I was nearly an "ideal husband" ... I thought. As I began to work with Gary on the material for this book, it became more and more clear that I was not a successful husband by any stretch of the imagination. I was providing for my wife's material needs and some of her physical needs, but that's where it stopped. As I got deeper into the content, I realized that for years I had been unaware of many of my wife's emotional needs. For years, she had to put up with a husband whose callousness and indifference forced her to suffer through day after day of not having her deeper needs lovingly satisfied. I am extremely grateful for all that I have learned in the past two months. At last my eyes have been opened, and I see my wife as the unique, beautiful individual that she really is. I am devoting the rest of my life to becoming the husband she deserves. The content of this book not only opened my eyes to my wife and her needs, but it gave me concrete ways to meet those needs. If you get one-tenth the value from this book that I have gleaned from its pages, it will be the most valuable book you'll ever read about marriage. Steve Scott <p>Chapter 1 How to Drive Your Wife Away Without Even Trying "You husbands likewise, live with your wives in an understanding way." 1 Peter 3:7 AT THE OTHER end of the phone a quivering voice said, "You've got to help me. She has a court order against me." George was coming to me for help after his relationship with his wife was already in shreds. "We've been married over twenty years, and she won't even let me back in the house. I can't believe she would treat me this way after all I've done for her. Can you help us get back together?" Before I answered his question, I wanted to talk to his wife. "There's no way you can talk to Barbara," he said. "She wouldn't talk to you. The moment you say you're representing me in any way, she'll hang up on you." "I've never been turned down by a wife yet," I assured him, "so we might as well see if this will be the first time. Would you give me her phone number?" To be honest, as grim as things sounded, I did wonder if she would be the first wife not willing to talk to me about her marital strife. But my doubts were unfounded&#x2014;she was more than anxious to discuss their problems. "What would it take for you to be willing to let your husband back into your life? What would have to happen before you would try to rebuild a marriage relationship with him?" Those were the same questions I had asked many wives who claimed they didn't want their husbands back. Her response was typical. "I can't possibly answer that question. He's the worst husband in the world, so I wouldn't think of taking him back. I can't stand his personality or his offensive habits any more." The court order would take care of him, she told me. "Just keep him away!" I gently asked her if she could tell me the things he had done to offend her. When I heard her response, I said, "It sounds like he hasn't been a very sensitive and gentle husband, has he?" Once again I asked her to stretch her imagination and think about what changes would be necessary before she would take him back. There was plenty of room for improvement, she told me. First, he was too domineering and critical of her. Second, he tried to control her every move with a possessive grip. Third, he trampled her sense of self-worth with constant ridicule. And fourth, although he always had time for business and other interests, he seldom took time to listen to her. On top of all that, he spied on her and didn't give her any freedom. "Don't get any ideas, though," she told me at the end of our conversation. "Because no matter what, I won't stop the divorce." When I relayed these complaints to George, I knew I had touched some sensitive spots. He defended himself and accused her. I let him rant for a while before asking, "Do you want your wife back?" "Yes, I'd do anything to get her back," he said. "Good. I'm always willing to work with someone ready to readjust his life. But if you're not totally serious, let me know now. I don't like to play games." Again he committed himself to change, but his commitment didn't last beyond my next statement. "We're going to have to work on your domineering and possessive nature. It shows you don't genuinely love your wife." He fumed and spouted, defended and fought so much I began to wonder if he really would commit himself to the necessary changes. "I've never met a more belligerent, stubborn man in my entire life!" I exclaimed. Suddenly subdued, he responded, "That's not my nature. I'm usually rather submissive inside. Maybe I'm putting up a front because I'm really not a pushy person. I feel like people run all over me." "I don't think you and I are talking about the same person," I responded. "If I were your wife, I'm not sure I could bear up emotionally under your domineering personality." That stopped him long enough for him to give our conversation some serious thought. After talking to his friends and even praying that God would help him understand, he returned to my office, able to confess his faults and ready to change.</p></p><h2>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Kiln-Formed Glass: Fused * Slumped * Cast</h2><p>In paperback at last, this popular guide to kiln-forming glass--melting cut or crushed glass and then shaping it with molds--features 19 beginner-friendly projects.

In this appearance, the annual will address the problematic of leisure or idleness in our ravenously consumptive, multi-national society, as originally explored by Paul Lafargue's notorious 1883 essay from St. Pelagie prison. Contributors include Amiri Baraka, John Baldessari, Guy Bennett, Frank Chin, Jeff Clark, Norma Cole, Corrado Costa, Douglas Messerli, Dennis Phillips, Leslie Scalapino, and many others.</p></p><p>Bigger than the Bangkok telephone book, this anthology of poetry from the U.S. and Canada testifies to the proliferation of experimental writing in the last several decades. It joins two recent collections, Paul Hoover's Postmodern American Poetry (Norton, 1994) and Eliot Weinberger's American Poetry Since 1950 (Marsilio, 1993); all three want to be for the present what Donald Allen's The New American Poetry (Grove, 1960) was for the '60s. A strength of Messerli's book: he offers space enough to each poet, so that readers can trace developing poetic concerns, beginning with the Objectivists. The anthology's first poem is Charles Reznikoff's "Children," a Holocaust piece, and much of what follows can be thought of as exploded fragments and tentative gatherings assembled from the wreckage of modernity. Nowhere is the alternately hopeful, tragic and inchoate postmodern condition better represented than in the blank pages that are the late John Cage's contribution--a performative silence that is the subtext of many another poem here, where words are, well, just words, and also worlds, and all over the place. One regrets certain exclusions--August Kleinzahler, Clayton Eshleman--and there are nine or 10 poets we could probably do without, who seem merely fashionable beside the powerful work of Susan Howe or Bernadette Mayer. But thanks are due, too, for the inclusion of writers who usually do not receive the attention they deserve even from avant-garde communities--John Taggart, for instance. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.The subtitle's referent may escape casual readers. It proclaims this anthology's lineage, connecting it to the important and influential <i>New American Poetry</i> edited by Donald Allen and published in 1960. So doing, it makes an ambitious claim, for Allen's collection enlarged both critical and popular visions of American poetry to encompass the Beats, the Black Mountain School, and other then unconventional voices. Like his esteemed predecessor, editor Messerli emphasizes noncanonical (but often influential) poets: Carl Rakosi, Jack Spicer, John Wieners, Ron Silliman, John Cage, Amiri Baraka, Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Leslie Scalapino. Messerli's four "groupings" of poets are made to show connections that drive beneath the hackneyed ones. Neither form nor style, neither theme nor content informs the groupings. Rather, Messerli groups according to more mysterious and organic relations. Poets concerned with myth and social issues; poets who focus on issues of self; poets who emphasize language and the reader; and finally, poets of the voice and performance--these are his four families. This hefty volume will certainly flesh out collections light in experimental poetics. <i>Pat Monaghan</i></p><h2>King Arthur: The True Story</h2><p>VG condition book with dust jacket.

Her next Deborah Knott novel, Southern Discomfort, was nominated for the Agatha Award for Best Novel; Shooting at Loons, which followed, received Agatha and Anthony award nominations, and Up Jumps the Devil won the Agatha for Best Novel of 1996.&#34;</p><h2>Gunpowder Plot (Daisy Dalrymple Mysteries, No. 15)</h2><p>In the winter of 1924, Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher travels to a school friend's house to witness the estate's famous Guy Fawkes celebration. But she gets more than&nbsp;a quiet weekend at the quaint family manse that she was originally hoping for. The home is the site of some severe family tension - the Viscount and head of family is a strict and unyielding sort, insisting that everyone - especially his children - meet his own&nbsp;unreasonable&nbsp;expectations. On the evening of the Guy Fawkes celebration, the Viscount is found dead on the floor of his study,&nbsp;killed by his own hand.&nbsp;What's more, he apparently first&nbsp;killed a guest&nbsp; - a married woman visiting England from Australia - before turning the gun on himself. Now it's up to Alec Fletcher, Daisy's husband and a DCI of Scotland Yard, to unravel the mystery and the long held family secrets that led to this state of affairs before anyone else can fall prey to the tragic cycle of events. A solution that will require, perhaps, more than a little help from Daisy herself.</p><p>Carola Dunn&nbsp;is the author of many previous mysteries featuring Daisy Dalrymple, most recently <i>Fall of a Philanderer</i>. Born and raised in England, she lives in Eugene, OregonChapter One&nbsp;<br>"I'm going to learn to drive," Daisy decided as the Triumph two-seater slowed on entering the village of Didmarsh-under-Edge.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I quite enjoy it," said Gwen. "Except for cranking the engine when it's cold."<br>&nbsp;<br>Though the November air was chilly, the sun shone on pale gold Cotswold stone, and Michaelmas daisies still bloomed in cottage gardens. Here and there, the last bronze and yellow leaves clung to the twigs of tall beeches and elms. "It would be spiffing to be able to hop in the car on a beautiful day like this and buzz out of London into the country for a few hours. I could go and visit Belinda, my stepdaughter, at school. Imagine not having to worry about train timetables and being picked up at the station and all that rot."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't mind picking you up at the station," Gwen assured her, her thin face earnest. Turning into a narrow, steeply rising lane between the churchyard and the Didmarsh Post Office and General Store, she raised her voice to be heard over the roar of the motor. "Would your husband let you drive?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Alec? Good gracious, he doesn't tell me what to do! Just because he's a policeman, it doesn't mean he tries to lay down the law. At least . . ."<br>&nbsp;<br>Daisy paused. She had been going to make an exception for the times when she found herself involved in one of Alec's cases, when he most definitely, if unsuccessfully, did attempt to control her actions. But those times were best not talked of, though Gwen had probably heard rumours through the Old Girls' network.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I wouldn't have married him if he'd shown signs of wanting to dictate what I can or can't do," she amended. "This is 1924, after all, not the Victorian Dark Ages. By the way, I hope you haven't told all your family that Alec's a policeman. Lots of people get a funny look in their eyes when they find out I'm a policeman's wife."<br>&nbsp;<br>"No, you asked me not to and I haven't. But I wasn't thinking so much about that; more about . . ." Gwen took her eyes from the road to cast a quick glance at Daisy's bulging midsection.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The baby?" Daisy patted the bulge, which her coat so nicely concealed when she was standing but seemed to emphasize when she was seated. "I suppose I'd better not take driving lessons until after it's born. Soon I won't be able to fit behind a steering wheel. Another three months! I never dreamt nine months could seem so long. But that has nothing to do with Alec."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Daisy!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Daisy laughed. "Sorry, I mean my being pregnant doesn't have anything to do with Alec being, or not being, dictatorial. If you see what I mean."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I do. I'm just so used to my father always getting his way--not just with Mother, with all of us--that I can't quite fathom how a modern marriage works. Here we are."<br>&nbsp;<br>The lane continued slanting upward across the steep slope, the Cotswold escarpment, between hedges wreathed with old-man's beard and berried briony. Soon the hedges gave way to drystone walls. After a quarter mile or so, always climbing, Daisy saw on their left stone gateposts bracketing a gap in the wall. Gwen neatly negotiated the sharp turn into the drive between open wrought-iron gates. In curlicued script picked out in gold, the left-hand gate bore the legend Edge, the right-hand Manor. The small gatehouse looked deserted.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No gatekeeper since the War," Gwen observed. "Biddle, our gardener, lives there now. He's not there during the day, of course, and Mrs. Biddle 'obliges' in the house, so we leave the gates open for convenience."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hardly anyone has gatekeepers these days."<br>&nbsp;<br>A row of yews sheltered the cottage to the north. As the Triumph drew level with the bushy evergreens, a series of ear-shattering explosions rang out. Daisy's heart skipped a beat before she realized the car was backfiring.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or was it? Gwen stamped on the brake, staring back at the trees. Following her gaze, Daisy saw movement amid the dark green foliage, and then her ears rang with a second set of bangs and pops. This time, guessing the cause, she spotted flashes on the road behind the car.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Squibs."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Those little devils!" Gwen jumped out of the car and tore in among the trees.<br>&nbsp;<br>She emerged triumphant a few moments later, each hand grasping the collar of a small, wiry, and decidedly grubby boy. She marched them over to the car. "Apologize to Mrs. Fletcher at once," she snapped, "or I'll tell your grandfather and he'll give you a proper whopping."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Mummy won't let him," the younger whined. He was eight or nine, the elder perhaps ten.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your mother won't hear about it till it's over. Addie's brats," she said to Daisy. "I expect you remember my sister Adelaide from school?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Vaguely. She's a couple of years older, isn't she?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, she'll be thirty in January." She shook the boys. "Hurry up and apologize, or it'll be too late."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sorry," the elder muttered sullenly, echoed by his brother.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gwen gave them another shake. "You can do better than that."<br>&nbsp;<br>"We're very sorry, Mrs. Fletcher, but it was only squibs. They're not dangerous or anything."<br>&nbsp;<br>"They jolly well are when you throw them at a car," their aunt pointed out. "I could have been startled enough to run it off the road. Get into the dickey, both of you, and be careful of Mrs. Fletcher's luggage. Adrian will have to sit on your lap, Reggie."<br>&nbsp;<br>"We don't want to go to the house," Reggie said mutinously.<br>&nbsp;<br>Adrian panicked. "We said sorry, Aunt Gwen. You can't tell Grandfather now!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I ought to. But I won't if you both empty your pockets and give me every squib you possess."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But we bought them with our own money!" Reggie protested. "What if we promise not to throw them at cars?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Every one," Gwen said, uncompromising.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well acquainted with the contents of her eldest nephew's pockets, Daisy was not surprised at the odds and ends laid out on the running board. Besides a dozen squibs, and a roll of caps, which Gwen also confiscated, the collection included three fluffy toffees, a matchbox containing two dead beetles, quantities of string, a stub of pencil, several small, smoothly rounded stones, and a catapult. Gwen hesitated over this last.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Didn't Aunt Babs take this away from you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"She just gave it back. We promised not to shoot at the farm animals or the greenhouses or anything. She kept it for a whole week, and it's a 'specially good one!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, all right. Take your stuff and get in."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Because I say so. Because you're going to tell your mother exactly what you did. Not that she'll do anything about it," Gwen muttered, resuming her place behind the steering wheel, her comment supported by the boys' insouciance as they climbed into the dickey. "I have a feeling I'm going to regret giving in over that catapult."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But they're easy to make," Daisy pointed out. "They could easily replace it."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Too true."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Boys will be boys," Daisy murmured, though she had always hated the second part of her nanny's favourite saying: "but girls must be young ladies."<br>&nbsp;<br>The drive led back across the hillside, for the most part on the level. As they passed some farm buildings on the lower slope, Gwen waved to a woman in trousers talking to a man perched high on the back of a massive cart horse.<br>&nbsp;<br>"My sister Barbara. She's the eldest of us."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Aunt Gwen?" came Adrian's quavery voice from behind. "You won't tell Aunt Babs, will you? About the squibs?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why shouldn't I?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Because she said if we do anything else bad this week, she'll duck us in the horse trough and she doesn't care if we catch our death of cold."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It would jolly well serve you right."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It would be murder," Reggie said self-righteously.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, we don't want murder in the family, so I won't tell her, as long as you behave yourselves till bedtime. Sorry, Daisy, when I invited you, I'd forgotten it was the boys' half-term holiday. And there are other ructions in the family at present, I'm afraid."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Never mind, I'll just ignore all that and concentrate on my article. It's jolly decent of your people to let me come. My American editor is really keen. They don't know about the Gunpowder Plot over there, so he thinks it's frightfully exotic. It came just before the Mayflower and the Pilgrims and all that, which is when their history begins."<br>&nbsp;<br>Gwen laughed. "If I recall correctly, we started at school with Caesar's invasion of Britain in something b.c."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But after that, there wasn't much besides Alfred and the cakes until 1066. I hope you'll be able to tell me the history of your Guy Fawkes celebration. It'd be nice to have some background as well as a description of tomorrow's f�te."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Father will be only too glad to expound."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Good." Daisy's insatiable curiosity got the better of her. "And if you want to let off steam about the ructions, I'll lend a sympathetic ear . . . or not, as the case may be."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It might help to have an outside opinion," Gwen said thoughtfully. "Besides, after all, your father was a viscount and Father's only a baronet."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I shouldn't dream of interfering! On that basis or any other."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What's a viscount?" Adrian enquired.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gwen and Daisy looked at each other in dismay. They had forgotten the little pitchers with big ears in the dickey.<br>&nbsp;<br>"A lord, you dunce," said Reggie, his manner insufferably superior.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm not a dunce!" Adrian was at a disadvantage, seated as he was on his brother's knees, but he made a spirited attempt to bring his fists to bear.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Horse trough!" Gwen warned.<br>&nbsp;<br>The rest of the journey was accomplished in peace.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Daisy had visited Edge Manor several times during her school days. She and Gwen had never been particularly intimate friends, but her own childhood home, Fairacres, was less than twenty miles away across country. She knew Gwen's family had owned the land hereabouts since the Wars of the Roses. The Tyndalls had accommodated themselves over the centuries to the whims of history, having managed to remain inconspicuous but always on the right side at the decisive moment, like the Vicar of Bray.<br>&nbsp;<br>Edge Manor, built and periodically rebuilt with local limestone, had likewise accommodated itself over the centuries to the whims of its owners and the exigencies of its situation halfway up a steep hillside. The south front, before which the Triumph drew up, was taller and narrower than most small country houses. To the right of the cobbled forecourt stretched a row of garages, once carriage houses, more usually tucked away somewhere out of view of residents and visitors.<br>&nbsp;<br>Beyond the fa�ade, the building stretched northward with, as Daisy recalled, a great many inconvenient flights of two or three or half a dozen steps here and there to adjust to the terrain. But to compensate, the long west side provided a spectacular view of the terraced gardens and the village and across the Vale of Evesham, where most of the Tyndall acres lay.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Leave your camera and typewriter in the car, Daisy," said Gwen. "Someone will fetch them. You boys can carry the rest in."<br>&nbsp;<br>She ushered Daisy into the house, followed by her subdued nephews struggling with the luggage. The wide entrance hall, two stories high, was floored with polished oak. Apart from a couple of antique chests, it was furnished as a sitting room, with sofas and chairs grouped on a large rug around a blaze in the fireplace opposite the front door. The late-afternoon sun poured in through tall south and west windows, each graced with a vase of golden beech leaves, crimson-berried hawthorn, and pink and orange spindle.<br>&nbsp;<br>This inviting scene was marred by the two angry men in the middle of the room.<br>&nbsp;<br>One was an imposing figure, whose voluminous plus fours and shooting jacket with baggy pockets made him appear even larger than his already-impressive size. Daisy recognized Sir Harold Tyndall. His girth had grown and his hairline had receded since last she saw him, but his reddish moustache bristled as fiercely as ever. A tall, bull-necked bear of a man, to mix a few metaphors, he was roaring like a lion: "What the devil made you suppose the bounder would be welcome at Edge Manor?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Miller is not a bounder, sir!" The boyish young man confronting him, bursting with indignation, was an inch or two taller and equally large-boned. However, his frame had not yet filled out and he was loose-limbed, lanky, in his light blue blazer with a Cambridge college crest on the pocket and wide-legged "Oxford bags." "He's a--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Pshaw! He's aiding and abetting this nonsense of yours, and he's got his eye on your sister, or I'm a Dutchman."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Gwen?" The youth must be Jack Tyndall, Daisy realized. She saw that Gwen was very pink-cheeked, whether embarrassed by an unwarranted assertion or dismayed by its accuracy. Jack, obviously astonished, continued, "I don't think--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"That's the trouble, my boy, you don't think! Tyndalls have run this estate for centuries, passed directly from father to son, and my son is not going to break that trust for some footling, short-lived fad."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Aeronautics is not a--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Father, Jack," Gwen interrupted, "here's Mrs. Fletcher."<br>&nbsp;<br>The combatants swung round. Sir Harold advanced to shake hands.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ah yes, Dalrymple's daughter. We're delighted to have you come and write about our festivities, Mrs. Fletcher. The Tyndalls have held a Guy Fawkes f�te nearly every year since 1606, even during the Commonwealth. Oddly enough, Bonfire Night was the only traditional festivity allowed by the Puritans, though it celebrates the foiling of a plot against the monarchy."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Cromwell should have been grateful to the plotters for their attempt to blow up James the First, which might have saved the Puritans the trouble of beheading Charles the First," said Jack. "How do you do, Mrs. Fletcher."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You remember my brother, Daisy? He must have been twelve or thirteen when you last met."<br>&nbsp;<br>"A horrible, cheeky pest of a schoolboy." Jack had a charming grin.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Not half as pestilent as--"<br>&nbsp;<br>Daisy nudged Gwen to remind her she had promised not to tell her father of his grandsons' misdeeds. The boys themselves had vanished.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack pulled an expressive grimace. "What have they done now?" he asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>But Sir Harold had not noticed the byplay, intent as he was on urging Daisy over to the windows so that he could point out the site of the fireworks display and the beginnings of the bonfire. "You see, down there on the meadow below the terraces? My gardeners and tenants have been piling up brush for weeks."<br>&nbsp;<br>As her host maundered on, telling how the fireworks had begun as a demonstration of loyalty to the first Stuart king and continued as a much anticipated local event, Daisy grew incre...</p><h2>A Man Called Ove</h2><p>Meet Ove. He&#39;s a curmudgeon - the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him &#39;the bitter neighbor from hell.&#39; But behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove&#39;s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents&#39; association to their very foundations.</p><p>Fredrik Backman is a Swedish blogger and columnist. He is author of a work of nonfiction, Things My Son Needs to Know About Life, and A Man Called Ove, his first novel, which has sold more than 500,000 copies in its native country and will be published in more than twenty-five languages all over the world. He was reported the most successful author in Sweden in 2013.<br><br>George Newbern has appeared in Father of the Bride, Father of the Bride II, Evening Star, Adventures in Babysitting, and many other films.

He&#x2019;s the kind of man who points at people he doesn&#x2019;t like the look of, as if they were burglars and his forefinger a policeman&#x2019;s flashlight. He stands at the counter of a shop where owners of Japanese cars come to purchase white cables. Ove eyes the sales assistant for a long time before shaking a medium-sized white box at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;So this is one of those O-Pads, is it?&#x201d; he demands.<br> <br>The assistant, a young man with a single-digit body mass index, looks ill at ease. He visibly struggles to control his urge to snatch the box out of Ove&#x2019;s hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, exactly. An iPad. Do you think you could stop shaking it like that . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove gives the box a skeptical glance, as if it&#x2019;s a highly dubious sort of box, a box that rides a scooter and wears tracksuit pants and just called Ove &#x201c;my friend&#x201d; before offering to sell him a watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see. So it&#x2019;s a computer, yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sales assistant nods. Then hesitates and quickly shakes his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes . . . or, what I mean is, it&#x2019;s an iPad. Some people call it a &#x2018;tablet&#x2019; and others call it a &#x2018;surfing device.&#x2019; There are different ways of looking at it. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove looks at the sales assistant as if he has just spoken backwards, before shaking the box again.<br> <br>&#x201c;But is it good, this thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant nods confusedly. &#x201c;Yes. Or . . . How do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove sighs and starts talking slowly, articulating his words as if the only problem here is his adversary&#x2019;s impaired hearing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is. It. Goooood? Is it a good computer?&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant scratches his chin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean . . . yeah . . . it&#x2019;s really good . . . but it depends what sort of computer you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove glares at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a computer! A normal bloody computer!&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence descends over the two men for a short while. The assistant clears his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . it isn&#x2019;t really a normal computer. Maybe you&#x2019;d rather have a . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant stops and seems to be looking for a word that falls within the bounds of comprehension of the man facing him. Then he clears his throat again and says:<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . a laptop?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove shakes his head wildly and leans menacingly over the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t want a &#x2018;laptop.&#x2019; I want a computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant nods pedagogically.<br> <br>&#x201c;A laptop is a computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove, insulted, glares at him and stabs his forefinger at the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think I don&#x2019;t know that!&#x201d;<br> <br>Another silence, as if two gunmen have suddenly realized they have forgotten to bring their pistols. Ove looks at the box for a long time, as though he&#x2019;s waiting for it to make a confession.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where does the keyboard pull out?&#x201d; he mutters eventually.<br> <br>The sales assistant rubs his palms against the edge of the counter and shifts his weight nervously from foot to foot, as young men employed in retail outlets often do when they begin to understand that something is going to take considerably more time than they had initially hoped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, this one doesn&#x2019;t actually have a keyboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove does something with his eyebrows. &#x201c;Ah, of course,&#x201d; he splutters. &#x201c;Because you have to buy it as an &#x2018;extra,&#x2019; don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, what I mean is that the computer doesn&#x2019;t have a separate keyboard. You control everything from the screen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove shakes his head in disbelief, as if he&#x2019;s just witnessed the sales assistant walking around the counter and licking the glass-fronted display cabinet.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I have to have a keyboard. You do understand that?&#x201d;<br> <br>The young man sighs deeply, as if patiently counting to ten.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. I understand. In that case I don&#x2019;t think you should go for this computer. I think you should buy something like a MacBook instead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A McBook?&#x201d; Ove says, far from convinced. &#x201c;Is that one of those blessed &#x2018;eReaders&#x2019; everyone&#x2019;s talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. A MacBook is a . . . it&#x2019;s a . . . laptop, with a keyboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; Ove hisses. He looks around the shop for a moment. &#x201c;So are they any good, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sales assistant looks down at the counter in a way that seems to reveal a fiercely yet barely controlled desire to begin clawing his own face. Then he suddenly brightens, flashing an energetic smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what? Let me see if my colleague has finished with his customer, so he can come and give you a demonstration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove checks his watch and grudgingly agrees, reminding the assistant that some people have better things to do than stand around all day waiting. The assistant gives him a quick nod, then disappears and comes back after a few moments with a colleague. The colleague looks very happy, as people do when they have not been working for a sufficient stretch of time as sales assistants.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, how can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove drills his police-flashlight finger into the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a computer!&#x201d;<br> <br>The colleague no longer looks quite as happy. He gives the first sales assistant an insinuating glance as if to say he&#x2019;ll pay him back for this.<br> <br>In the meantime the first sales assistant mutters, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take anymore, I&#x2019;m going for lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch,&#x201d; snorts Ove. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only thing people care about nowadays.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; says the colleague and turns around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch!&#x201d; He sneers, then tosses the box onto the counter and swiftly walks out.</p><h2>Pilates for Beginners</h2><p>An easy-to-follow, stand-up guide to 30 of the most popular Pilates exercises, each designed to streamline and tone your body.

By the author of Compelling Evidence. 85,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Steve Martini, a former trial attorney, has worked as a journalist and capital correspondent in the California State House in Sacramento. He has been engaged in both public and private practice of law. He lives on the US West Coast.Defense attorney Paul Madriani (Compelling Evidence, 1992) signs on for a brief stint in the Davenport, California, prosecutor's office--then finds himself condemned to try a high-profile serial killing. Three couples have been murdered by somebody whose MO is distinctively grisly--they're staked to the ground with tent pegs, another peg driven through their hearts--but the third incident is different in enough ways (much older couple, different kind of rope, tent pegs not sharpened to a point) to suggest a copycat killer. Still, after Paul and his investigators turn up Andre Iganovich, a suspect for the first two pairs of murders, everybody--from Paul's impatient wife Nikki to the judges to the Davenport powers that be, even to Adrian Chambers, the venal defense attorney representing Iganovich, and certainly including the anonymous caller threatening Paul's family if he doesn't include the last two murders in the indictment--wants Paul to close the case by pinning all six crimes on Iganovich instead of continuing to search for the copycat. But Paul's determined to track down the missing witness to the last two murders, a man who has his own reasons for keeping quiet about why he was perched in a tree high above the fatal scene. The obligatory impossible obstacles--constant pressure from Paul's old nemesis Judge Armando Acosta; the incompetence and possible treachery of graying junior prosecutor Roland Overroy; an extradition mess when Iganovich flees the country; and the unprincipled enmity of Chambers, on the rebound from a disbarment arranged partly by Paul--come at Paul helter-skelter, without much rhyme or reason, until midway through the book, when the trial begins and Martini rolls up his sleeves to do what he does best. Not as twisty or deeply felt as Compelling Evidence, but not as overwrought either--and the unbelievable ending packs a satisfying punch. Good medium-grade beach fare. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

G. Dunn clarifies in rich detail the beginnings of the full Christian belief in Christ as the Son of God and incarnate Word. By employing the exegetical methods of &#34;historical context of meaning&#34; and &#34;conceptuality in transition,&#34; Dunn illumines the first-century meaning of key titles and passages within the New Testament that bear directly on the develop-ment of the Christian understanding of Jesus. Chosen by Christianity Today as one of the year&#39;s &#34;Significant Books&#34; when it first appeared in 1980, this second edition of Christology in the Making contains a new extended foreword that responds to critics of the first edition and updates Dunn&#39;s own thinking on the beginnings of Christology since his original work.</p><p>&#34;An excellent presentation of a mass of complicated material and secondary comment thereon, much to be commended for its honest attempt to set Paul et al. in the eschatological setting of the earliest Christian gospel rather than reading their statements through the incarnational spectacles of later developments.&#34;</p><h2>State of the Union: A Century of American Labor (Politics and Society in Modern America)</h2><p><p>In a fresh and timely reinterpretation, Nelson Lichtenstein examines how trade unionism has waxed and waned in the nation's political and moral imagination, among both devoted partisans and intransigent foes. From the steel foundry to the burger-grill, from Woodrow Wilson to John Sweeney, from Homestead to Pittston, Lichtenstein weaves together a compelling matrix of ideas, stories, strikes, laws, and people in a streamlined narrative of work and labor in the twentieth century.</p><p>The "labor question" became a burning issue during the Progressive Era because its solution seemed essential to the survival of American democracy itself. Beginning there, Lichtenstein takes us all the way to the organizing fever of contemporary Los Angeles, where the labor movement stands at the center of the effort to transform millions of new immigrants into alert citizen unionists. He offers an expansive survey of labor's upsurge during the 1930s, when the New Deal put a white, male version of industrial democracy at the heart of U.S. political culture. He debunks the myth of a postwar "management-labor accord" by showing that there was (at most) a limited, unstable truce.</p><p>Lichtenstein argues that the ideas that had once sustained solidarity and citizenship in the world of work underwent a radical transformation when the rights-centered social movements of the 1960s and 1970s captured the nation's moral imagination. The labor movement was therefore tragically unprepared for the years of Reagan and Clinton: although technological change and a new era of global economics battered the unions, their real failure was one of ideas and political will. Throughout, Lichtenstein argues that labor's most important function, in theory if not always in practice, has been the vitalization of a democratic ethos, at work and in the larger society. To the extent that the unions fuse their purpose with that impulse, they can once again become central to the fate of the republic. <i>State of the Union</i> is an incisive history that tells the story of one of America's defining aspirations.</p></p><p>Does anyone still look for the union label? Apparently not, to gauge historian Nelson Lichtenstein's history of the rise, heyday, and long decline of labor unions in America.<p> In the Progressive era, Lichtenstein writes, the "labor question" lay at the heart of a whole complex of political ideas governing the social betterment of working people and the development of a more equitable society. These ideas flourished through the course of the early twentieth century, as unions attained more and more influence and as Keynesian notions of organized labor being "essential to boost mass purchasing power and thereby sustain economic growth" became established. After World War II, however, unionism began a slow collapse, helped along by the rise of conservative, antilabor politics. Although ideas of workplace justice and the extension of civil rights into the private sector remain strong, organized labor has not--with the result, Lichtenstein argues, that many American workers are worse off today than they were a quarter of a century ago. Lichtenstein's narrative capably summarizes trends in modern labor history, and it provides much fuel for activists seeking renewed labor-based politics. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>"Scholars have come to look to Nelson Lichtenstein for state-of-the-art work on American labor history. Now he has synthesized his immense learning into a powerful narrative of the ups and downs of unions since the New Deal. Elegiac, sympathetic, and keenly realistic, <i>State of the Union</i> focuses, above all, on the role of ideas and ideology in shaping contentious outcomes. The writing is engaged, analytically suggestive, and thoughtfully revisionist. Not just students of trade unions, but historians of the moments and episodes Lichtenstein chronicles, will be wrestling with this fascinating book for a long time to come."<b>--Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This is a brilliant work of historical synthesis and interpretation. No other historian has produced a narrative that cogently surveys intellectual developments, economic change, political and legal conflict, and the complexities of labor's internal struggles and weaves them into a compelling narrative that makes sense of the rise and fall of the working-class movement."<b>--Michael Kazin, Professor of History, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"Lichtenstein's textured account offers an impressive combination of astute historical analysis and keen social insight. Lichtenstein demonstrates how, despite its civil rights origins, the 'rights revolution' of the past generation has joined free-market ideology in undermining the legal and social basis for worker solidarity and union success. Greater individual freedoms have ironically not always helped the working people of America."<b>--David Abraham, Professor of Law, University of Miami Law School</b></p><p>"Nelson Lichtenstein, one of our leading historians, follows the movement for democracy and rights at work over the last hundred years, offering a masterful synthesis of the new labor history and the first comprehensive framework for a history of labor in our time."<b>--Dorothy Sue Cobble, Professor of Labor Studies, Rutgers University</b></p><p>"<i>State of the Union</i> is a uniquely important study of the labor movement in twentieth-century American politics. Lichtenstein demonstrates both an intricate, grounded knowledge of union dynamics and a finely nuanced, sophisticated understanding of American political history since the New Deal. This book is a must read for anyone seriously interested in making sense of American politics during the last three-quarters of a century."<b>--Adolph Reed, Professor of Political Science on the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science, New School University, and member of the Interim National Council of the Labor Party</b></p><p>"You can find no better guide to the past and present of the American labor movement than Nelson Lichtenstein. Aimed at a general audience, this book shows how the health of American democracy depends on vital working-class organizations. It examines why unions have flourished in the past and asks how they may do so again."<b>--William Forbath, Professor of Law and History, University of Texas, Austin, and author of<i>Law and the Shaping of the American Labor Movement</i></b></p><p>"Why has the labor movement's ability to speak collectively on behalf of American workers declined so dramatically? Ranging confidently across political, intellectual, social, and economic history, Nelson Lichtenstein gives us a sweeping and provocative analysis of the 'labor question' in the past fifty years--and how workers' basic democratic rights have been increasingly marginalized, contained, or eliminated. He eloquently reminds us that if we are to have democracy in America, we must celebrate, not repress, basic human rights at the workplace."<b>--Dana Frank, Professor of American Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz</b></p></p><h2>The Princess and Curdie</h2><p>This 1883 fantasy story by George MacDonald is the sequel to The Princess and the Goblin.

He is the author of the acclaimed L.A. Quartet:&nbsp; <em>The Black Dahlia</em>, <em>The Big Nowhere</em>, <em>LA Confidential</em>, and <em>White Jazz</em>.</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p> I was thrilled, captivated, deeply moved and wholly <em>subsumed </em>by the world that Tom Mallon created. Washington D.C. from '72 to '74 circumscribes farce, tragedy, a reimagining of the political landscape and the reinstigation of <em>grandeur</em> into the fictional body politic. The book is fever dream, wolf whistle and history as plain and simple human longing; the book encapsulates no less than <em>everything.</em> I finished the last page and wept for an hour; I remain stunned 48 hours later. The laughter, the horror, the pathos, the tawdry drama of small people and their fatuous lusts and drives--ever falling short--but, somehow--achieving a transcendental interconnectedness. <em>Watergate</em> is certainly a masterpiece. More importantly, it is a concurrently credible and fantastic subversion of all our perceived notions of a smugly overreported event and an underscrutinized time and place. By casting Richard Nixon as heroic and as misunderstood as the man considered himself to be, Tom has reset the time-lock on every didactic and dismissive polemic and psych-bio ever written about our 37th president. Here, Nixon himself achieves <em>grandeur</em>; here, he will live as the embodiment of glorious intransigence and twisted courage.<p><b>Thomas Mallon</b> is the author of eight novels, including<i> Henry and Clara, Dewey Defeats Truman,</i> and <i>Fellow Travelers, </i>and seven works of nonfiction.

The best time to travel, from a scenic point of view, is spring, when the south has not yet reached full heat and the north looks astonishingly fertile - above all, around the orchards and vineyards of Cap Bon. Be warned, though, that March and April are the dampest months of the year in the south and it can bucket down in the north. </p><p>Summer has mixed virtues. July and August are much the hottest months of the year - if only slightly more so than in the southern parts of Italy or Greece - and the one time you really do need to lapse into a local way of life, for example resting through the midday hours at a caf&#x17d; or taking a siesta at your hotel. Obviously this goes above all for the deep south and the ksour (see Chapter Nine). On the more exposed beaches of the north coast, midsummer is actually a pull - some of them are only warm enough for swimming from around May until October. If you wait until autumn, you get the best of both worlds, with warm swimming and few crowds, even at the big resorts. </p><p>In winter, the north and the Tell can get distinctly cold; A�n Draham, the highest mountain town, commonly has a metre of snow, and in 1985 it even snowed at Bizerte on the Mediterranean coast. Tunis, Cap Bon and Sousse are not so much cold in winter as dull, with sporadic rains. But this is an ideal time for covering the ancient sites at leisure and then migrating south to Jerba's beaches and the Sahara.</p></p><h2>The MONKEY AND THE TIGER</h2><p>Brand new unread copy. ships free upgrade first class with tracking.</p><p></p><h2>A Thousand Days in Venice (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p><b><i><br><br></i></b>He saw her across the Piazza San Marco and fell in love from afar.

His iconic portraits of its majestic animals are filled with an empathy usually reserved for human subjects.&nbsp;From the opening images in A Shadow Falls, of a verdant world filled with multitudes of animals, to the closing images of small bands of creatures moving across a parched, dusty earth, Brandt portrays a mythic Africa struggling against tragic forces.

Barry Hannah's reputation as a master of the short story, first established in 1978 with the publication of Airships, is magnified in this volatile, long-awaited collection of new stories. Astonishing in range and in the portrayal of the human heart, these fierce and radar-perfect stories give us individuals with whom hilarity and pain combine with true and startling clarity.</p><p>In his long-anticipated but disappointing second volume of short stories, one of the gurus of contemporary "guy" fiction ( Airships ; Boomerang ) focuses on the red-blooded American subjects with which he has made his reputation--sex, booze, drugs and guns. The visceral description for which Hannah has rightly been praised in the past degenerates here into bad-taste verbosity and sophomoric prurience. "High-Water Railers" concerns fishing and old men, one named Sidney Farte, as they share sexual secrets and confessions of missed opportunity. "Scandale d'Estime" begins with great promise in Kosciusko, Miss. (Hannah's home state), as old reprobate Harold befriends teenage George and takes him to a production of Waiting for Godot ; the story line (which also includes the young man's infatuation with an older woman) disintegrates into short takes on paregoric addiction, attempted suicide, the Klan, and bondage equipment. The best story, "The Spy of Loog Root," pairs the telescope-toting scion of a white-trash clan with the owner of a tobacco and magazine shop in Montana, and shows what Hannah is capable of in terms of characterization and emotional insight. For the most part, though, he seems to have invested more time in pompous, overwritten story titles--"Upstairs, Mona Bayed for Dong," "Hey, Have You got a Cig, the Time, the News, My Face?"--than in polishing the pieces themselves (some of which consist of only a few paragraphs). Half of these 23 stories have been published in magazines; a few aren't ready to be published anywhere. Too much of this volume reads like the output of a writing group that meets in a bar; as the saying goes, "You had to be there." Author tour. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hannah's approach to writing is wonderfully summed up by a character named Harold in the story "Scandale d'Estime." "Scandal is delicious, little man. All we are is obsession and pain. That is all humans are. And when these things go public and are met with howls, they ring out the only honest history we have. They are unbearable! Magnificent! Wicked!" Indeed, there is a fierceness to these 23 pieces (to call them all stories is something of a misnomer) that generates both power and perturbation. In his drive to get to the essence of things, Hannah takes no prisoners. Some readers will find his work misogynistic and offensive in its violence, yet beneath its often tormented surface lies a desperate, almost tender search for truth. Coming out of the Southern tradition, Hannah writes with fervor and, in spite of the violence, considerable humor. He is willing to take chances, to go to the edge, to challenge the reader in untypical ways. Not a "mainstream" work, this book nonetheless belongs in most library collections.

So why doesn&#x2019;t your garden satisfy? The problem just might be a lack of hardscaping structures like arbors, paving, walls, fountains, pools, and decks that delineate, ornament, animate, and add dimensionality to a garden. Using both his own and others&#x2019; layouts, a top garden designer reveals why these structures are so important and how to incorporate them into the landscape. Each chapter examines a specific principle (creating balance, instilling motion, establishing focal points), and features illuminating discussions of style, function, application, and plantings, as well as magnificent projects. Bring fresh life to a garden with a curvaceous patio with a rill, a sculpture plinth on a terraced platform, or a Victorian room.&#x201d;</p><p><i>A Selection of the Homestyle Book Club.</i></p></p><p>Gardens consisting solely of flowering and foliage plants may be lovely, but they may also lack a sense of unification or completion. One way of introducing structure, interest, balance, and focus to a botanically dense landscape is through the application of hardscape elements. Whether it's a simple concrete birdbath emerging from a groundcover bed or an elaborate masonry walkway meandering through a perennial border, such structural ornamentation can be incorporated into gardens of any style and size. Giving straightforward advice and instruction, Davitt guides gardeners through the function and purpose of paths, walls, fountains, arbors, and other garden structures; helpfully suggests companion plantings; and provides dramatic before-and-after color photographs to illustrate the power of hardscape to transform and improve garden settings. <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For 15 months, Sebastian Junger accompanied a single platoon of thirty men from the celebrated 2nd battalion of the U.S. Army, as they fought their way through a remote valley in Eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of five trips, Junger was in more firefights than he could count, men he knew were killed or wounded, and he himself was almost killed. His relationship with these soldiers grew so close that they considered him part of the platoon, and he enjoyed an access and a candidness that few, if any, journalists ever attain. But this is more than just a book about Afghanistan or the &#39;War on Terror&#39;; it is a book about the universal truth of all men, in all wars. Junger set out to answer what he thought of as the &#39;hand grenade question&#39;: why would a man throw himself on a hand grenade to save other men he has probably known for only a few months? The answer is elusive but profound, and goes to the heart of what it means not just to be a soldier, but to be human. &#39;War&#39; is a narrative about combat: the fear of dying, the trauma of killing and the love between platoon-mates who would rather die than let each other down. Gripping, honest, intense, it explores the neurological, psychological and social elements of combat, and the incredible bonds that form between these small groups of men.</p><p><strong>Evan Thomas and Sebastian Junger: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas and asked them to interview each other. <br> <br> <strong>Evan Thomas</strong> is one of the most respected historians and journalists writing today. He is the author of <em>The War Lovers</em>. <strong>Sebastian Junger</strong> is an internationally acclaimed author and a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and has been awarded a National Magazine Award and an SAIS Novartis Prize for journalism. He is the author of <em>War</em>. Read on to see Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas talk about their books.<br> <br> <p></p> <p><b>Evan Thomas</b>: War really is hell in your book. And yet it seems to captivate some of the men who fight it. Why?</p> <p><b>Sebastian Junger</b>: War is hell, as the saying goes--but it isn't only that. It's a lot of other things, too--most of them delivered in forms that are way more pure and intense than what is available back home. The undeniable hellishness of war forces men to bond in ways that aren't necessary--or even possible-- in civilian society. The closest thing to it might be the parent-child bond, but that is not reciprocal. Children are generally not prepared to die for their parents, whereas the men in a platoon of combat infantry for the most part are prepared to do that for each other. For a lot of men, the security of being enclosed by a group like that apparently outweighs the terrors of being in combat. During World War II, wounded soldiers kept going AWOL from the rear-base hospitals in order to rejoin their units on the front line. Clearly, for those men, rejoining their comrades was more important than the risk of death.</p> <p>I'm curious about the reactions of foot soldiers in previous wars--the Civil War, the Spanish-American War. Are there letters from soldiers describing their anguish at being separated from their comrades? Or is this a modern phenomenon? </p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: In the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt made a cult out of his band of brothers, the Rough Riders, with the twist that he was bringing together gentlemen and cowboys to be true Americans. It was a romantic ideal but largely realized in the short (several week) war they fought--two battles, about a 15 percent casualty rate. The anguish you speak of was felt by the Rough Riders who were left behind--there was no room on the transports for roughly a third of Roosevelt's troopers, and they had to stay behind in Florida. Roosevelt wrote of them weeping over being separated from their comrades and missing out on the fight.</p> <p>Roosevelt's war lust was sated by the Spanish-American War--for a time. He was not a notably bellicose president ("Talk softly but carry a big stick"). But when World War I came, he was almost pathologically driven to get back into the fight. He badgered President Wilson to let him raise a division. (Wilson, not wanting to create a martyr, said no.) Do you think the brotherhood of combat is in some ways addictive? What is it like for the soldiers and marines coming home?</p> <p><b>Junger</b>: It's amazing to see these same themes played out war after war. Politicians seize war for themselves, in some ways, and the public certainly holds them accountable for it--but the men who actually do the fighting are extraordinarily conflicted about it all. Only one man in the platoon I was with chose to leave the army after the deployment--Brendan O'Byrne, a main character in my book and now someone I consider a good friend. A few weeks ago we were hanging out with a family I know, and the talk turned to how rough the fighting was in Afghanistan. The mother, a woman in her thirties, asked Brendan if there was anything he missed about the experience. Brendan looked at her and said, without any irony, "Yes, almost all of it." I think what Brendan meant was that he missed an existence where every detail mattered--whether you tied your shoelaces, whether you cleaned your rifle--and you never had to question the allegiance of your friends. As Brendan said at another point, "There are guys in the platoon who straight-up hate each other-- but they'd all die for each other." Once they've been exposed to that, it's very hard for these guys to go back to a seemingly meaningless and ill-defined civilian life.</p> <p> What happened to the men after they returned from their adventures with Roosevelt? Where did their lives lead them?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: The Rough Riders seem to have had endless reunions--but nothing like the PTSD so widely reported today. But perhaps that was because they were only fighting for about a month--a "splendid little war," as diplomat John Hay called it, apparently without irony. In <i>The War Lovers</i>, I was looking at another kind of camaraderie--the bond of men who want to get the country into war, who think that war will somehow restore the nation to spiritual greatness. Roosevelt and his best friend, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, believed that America at the end of the 19th century had become "overcivilized"--that young men were turning soft and needed to somehow stir "the wolf rising in the heart," as Roosevelt put it. "All the great races have been fighting races," he said. It is significant that Roosevelt and Lodge, who pushed America to go to war with Spain in 1898, had written about war a great deal but never seen it. President William McKinley resisted; he had, as he noted, seen "the dead piled up at Antietam" in the Civil War. But the hawks in America were able to roll the doves, not for the last time.</p> <p>Before <i>The War Lovers</i> I wrote <i>Sea of Thunder</i>, a book about the last naval battle of World War II, Leyte Gulf. I interviewed a number of survivors from the USS Johnston, a destroyer sunk in the battle after an unbelievably brave fight against superior forces. About 220 men went in the water but only about half of them were rescued. Because of a series of mistakes by the navy, they were left in the water for two and half days. The sharks came on the first night. For a long time, the survivors did not talk much about it. But then, after Tom Brokaw wrote <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, they began having reunions and speaking--almost compulsively--bout their experiences. The recollections are often harrowing. Yet even years later, when the veterans compiled their recollections in a book of about eighty oral histories, the veterans did not speak of their own fear, with only one exception, as I recall. Somehow acknowledging fear remained a taboo.</p> <p></p> <p>In <i>War</i> you write about fear in clinical and fascinating ways. Did you have a hard time getting men to talk about fear? </p> <p><b>Junger</b>: Getting the men to talk about fear was very hard because, well, I think they were afraid of it. Their biggest worry seemed to be failing the other men of the platoon in some way, and whenever someone got killed, a common reaction was to search their own actions for blame. They didn't want to believe that a good man could get killed for no reason; someone had to be at fault. During combat, their personal fear effectively got subsumed by the greater anxiety that they would fail to do their job and someone else would get killed. The shame of that would last a lifetime, and they would literally do suicidal things to help platoon mates who were in danger. The classic story of a man throwing himself on a hand grenade--certain death, but an action that will almost certainly save everyone else--is neither a Hollywood clich� nor something that only happened in wars gone by. It is something that happens with regularity, and I don't think it can be explained by "army training" or any kind of suicidal impulse. I think that kind of courage goes to the heart of what it means to be human and to affiliate with others in a kind of transcendent way. Of course, once you have experienced a bond like that, everything else looks pathetic and uninteresting. That may be one reason combat vets have such a hard time returning to society..</p> <p>My guess is that the survivors of the USS Johnston were more traumatized by the deaths of their comrades than the prospect of their own death. Did any of them speak to that? What were their nightmares about? Has anyone studied the effect of that trauma on their lives--divorce rate, suicide rate, that kind of thing?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: They certainly described the deaths of their colleagues--who went mad from drinking seawater, or were killed by sharks, or died from untreated wounds or exposure (the seawater was about 86 degrees at night, cold if you spent all night immersed in it). Some just swam away and drowned. In one or two cases, men begged to be put out of their misery and were. There were complicated emotions over the deaths. There wasn't enough room on the rafts for all the men, so when one died, it made room for another. I am sure there was terrible guilt, but I didn't get into it with the survivors I interviewed. I don't think they were studied as a cohort. I think they were expected to go on with their lives, and I think by and large they did.</p> <p>Nations are changed by war--but somehow, only for a time. We have a way of forgetting the horrors of war, in the need young men (and old men who missed war) have to some experience the greatest challenge to their manhood. This was true in the period I wrote about in <i>The War Lovers</i>, more than three decades after the Civil War: men like Roosevelt and Lodge wanted to somehow experience the glories of war, and not think too hard about the way wars often turn out in unexpected ways. I know in Cuba, where I visited to research <i>The War Lovers</i>, the Cubans don't think of the Americans as their liberators from Spanish rule, but rather as foreign invaders. That's unfair, and in many ways just plain wrong, but not so hard to understand if you put yourself in the shoes of a country occupied by a foreign army. Some things never change.</p> <br><br>Sebastian Junger is the bestselling author of The Perfect Storm and A Death in Belmont.

They offer us refuge: a place to play, a place to think. They are the generous providers of timber and energy. They let us dream of other ways of living. Yet we now face a future where taking a walk in the woods is consigned to the tales we tell our children. <br> <br>Immersing himself in the beauty of woodland Britain, Peter Fiennes explores our long relationship with the woods and the sad and violent story of how so many have been lost. Just as we need them, our woods need us too. But who, if anyone, is looking out for them?</p><p><b>Peter Fiennes</b> is the author of <i>To War with God</i>, a moving account of his grandfather&#x2019;s service in WWI. He lives in Wandsworth, south-west London."<i>Oak and Ash and Thorn</i> is a lament. A lament for the trees and forests we have lost since the first axe glistened and the first torch flared. The destruction frequently came from plain necessity, but also, to our shame, from greed, stupidity and, as Fiennes suggests, fear. Despite the inventory of tragedy in his book, Fiennes is the best of guides, gently, eloquently and with a fierce humour telling a sad story &#x2013; relating chapters of fascinating detail to brighten his tale and quoting the poets as he goes. Despite the calamity that our relationship with trees has become, this is not a depressing book. Oak and Ash and Thorn may be a lament, but Fiennes invigorates and arms us with the knowledge to ensure that it will not become a requiem."

He won the 2004 Caldecott Medal for <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> and is also a painter, sculptor, and prizewinning designer and director of animated films. Mordicai Gerstein lives in western Massachusetts with his wife, Susan Yard Harris, who is also an illustrator, and their daughter, Risa. </p>Grade 2 Up This story of the death and reincarnation of a Tibetan woodcutter is a beautifully gentle look at one human being dealing with life's choices and possibilities. As a boy, he thought about other worlds that he would someday visit; as a man, he thought of other countries and people, yet ``he was always busy with his work and his wife and children.'' After his death, he is given the option of being part of ``the endless universe some call heaven'' or living another life, and he chooses another life. The choices which follow take him through all the galaxies, stars, planets, creatures, peoples, countries, and parents before arriving at the final twist in this journey back to where he had beenalmost. Thus, the story comes full circle. The quiet, rhythmic text is in perfect unity with the softly colored but radiant watercolor and gouache illustrations, leaving readers with a sense of wholeness and resolution. The golden borders neatly tuck the story in and add to its feeling of satisfaction and quiet joy. The real world scenes are in neatly boxed frames while the worlds of possibilities are displayed in mandala-like circular drawings. The main character, pictured in his small personal mandala, shows a range of emotions and dance-like movement. The kites held by the children in three scenes connect the multiple worlds of the story, providing both a grounding in the world we know and a means to soar beyond it. Children will appreciate the well-told tale and the joyous satisfaction of being one's own self in a large and magical world. Kay E.

Chimneys, retaining walls, foundations, decorative walks and planters, steps, and all varieties of construction masonry are covered here with excellent diagrams; explanations of terminology, tools, and materials; and photographs that vividly illustrate some of the finer points of masonry work. <p> Kreh's many years as a teacher of masonry techniques and practices shine through for the reader with no prior knowledge of masonry with clear, easy-to-understand terminology and a step-by-step approach, and his extensive experience and knowledge will open the eyes of longtime professionals with pointers and shortcuts they may not know themselves. This is a thorough, complete guide to masonry for all. <i>--Mark A. Hetts</i></p><p>Dick Kreh is a retired instructor from Linganore High School near Frederick, MD, and a well-known masonry expert in the field.

After enduring the Blitz in London, he returned to New York, where he encountered the vibrant art and cultural scene of&nbsp; the 1940s. He made his home first in New York, then Aspen, and finally Guanajuato, Mexico and was married four times. During his life he met people who shaped and exemplified the twentieth century: Winston Churchill, E. B. White and Ursula Nordstrom, Laura Ingalls Wilder, and countless more.</p><p>This is a biography of Garth Williams as an artist and an illustrator. It is the story of how his journey led him from winning sculpture awards at the Royal College of Art in London, to capturing the essence of frontier life in the American West, to rendering the humanity of beloved animal characters. The biography also explores the historical context that affected Williams&#x2019; life and art, both in the old world and the new. Against the frenetic pace of post-war suburbanization, Williams&#x2019; illustrations nurtured a connection with the animal world and with a vanishing agrarian life. By tapping into American themes, Williams spoke to a postwar yearning for simplicity.</p><p></p><p>Complete with more than 60 illustrations, this is the first full biography of Garth Williams written with the help and cooperation of his family.</p></p><p><p>Holding a Ph.

But as the time until his release ticks away, he can feel a storm brewing. Two days before he gets out, his wife Laura dies in a mysterious car crash, in adulterous circumstances. Dazed, Shadow travels home, only to encounter the bizarre Mr Wednesday claiming to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America. Together, they embark on a very strange journey across the States, along the way solving the murders which have occurred every winter in one small American town. But the storm is about to break...Disturbing, gripping and profoundly strange, Gaiman&#39;s epic new novel sees him on the road to the heart of America. It includes extra material exclusive to &#34;Headline Review&#39;s&#34; edition.</p><p><i>American Gods</i> is Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet, a scary, strange, and hallucinogenic road-trip story wrapped around a deep examination of the American spirit. Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since his Sandman days.<p> Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book. </p><p> Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. "This is a bad land for Gods," says Shadow.</p><p> More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><i>American Gods</i> by Neil Gaiman has won the 2001 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel at the Horror Writers Association Annual Meeting held that was held June 7-9 in New York City.</p><h2>Painting Wildlife in Watercolor</h2><p>Peggy Macnamara, the only artist-in-residence at Chicago&#39;s Field Museum, shares her unique &#34;No-Fear&#34; approach to capturing all forms of wildlife in living, luminous watercolor.

When Rabbit suddenly disappears, no one knows where he has gone. His friends are desolate. But, as it turns out, Rabbit has left behind some very special gifts for them, to help them discover their own unrabbity talents! Rabbityness celebrates individuality, encourages the creativity in everyone and positively introduces children to dealing with loss of any kind.</p><p>There are certain activities that qualify as &#x201c;rabbity&#x201d;: hopping, jumping, burrowing, and so on. And the rabbit in this picture book does all of these things, but he also engages in pursuits that are decidedly unrabbity, namely painting and making music. The opening spreads, which depict Rabbit doing his typical rabbit thing, are illustrated by debut author-illustrator Empson as small, dark, minimalist spots. But when readers turn the page onto the fourth spread, they will be delighted to find it brimming with bright abstract art and an ebullient Rabbit clutching a paintbrush. Unfortunately, partway through, Rabbit up and disappears, and all we see on the page are some representative sad floating leaves. Rabbit never returns, which is an unusual ending for a picture book, but he leaves behind a creative legacy. Empson&#x2019;s illustrations, which switch back and forth between black-and-white and full color, chart the emotional course for the book. Rabbit&#x2019;s disappearance&#x2014;and the aftermath&#x2014;will speak to children about looking on the bright side during times of loss or change, while proving the uplifting nature of art.

A decade and four books later, readers are as enthusiastic as ever. This 10th-anniversary edition celebrates the journey that Eragon, Christopher Paolini, and his millions of fans have all made together.</p><p>Here's a great big fantasy that you can pull over your head like a comfy old sweater and disappear into for a whole weekend. Christopher Paolini began <i>Eragon</i> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p> Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. </p><p> In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <i>Eldest</i>. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Eragon is a very special book. It is a great story, one that will you'll remember long after you finish it. Eragon inspires passion in fans. We invite you to read Eragon and see for yourself what the buzz is all about. <p>Eragon was nominated for the American Library Association 2003 Best Books For Young Adults Award.</p></p><h2>Dominion (Ollie Chandler #2)</h2><p><b>Sweet Revenge?</b> <br><br>When two senseless killings hit close to home, columnist Clarence Abernathy seeks revenge for the murders&#x2014;and, ultimately, answers to his own struggles regarding race and faith.

N.L. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Balance in Movement: The Seat of the Rider</h2><p>The art of successful riding lies in the development of harmony to such a degree that, to the onlooker, horse and rider perform in total unity. The rider&#39;s key to this ideal is not a static seat, but one that is capable of making finely tuned movements with which to communicate and remain in perfect balance with the horse. Susanne von Dietze, a well-known physical therapist and riding instructor in her native Germany, has made a study of the complex physical relationship between horses and their riders. In Balance in Movement, she breaks new ground in helping riders to understand the anatomical requirements that are crucial for establishing the perfect seat. She explains how riders can control their movements effortlessly and exactly in order to achieve a uniquely efficient system for aiding and influencing the horse. Illustrated throughout with exceptionally helpful photos and drawings, Balance in Movement is an invaluable contribution to technical equestrian literature.</p><p><b>Susanne von Dietze</b> is a physiotherapist, riding instructor, and active dressage competitor.

But when Tom�s returns to Madrid from his studies at Oxford, he is a changed man. Unbeknownst to her, he has been approached by an agent from the British intelligence services, and he has unwittingly set in motion events that will derail forever the life they had planned. With peerless insight into the most shadowed corners of the human soul, Mar�as plunges the reader into the growing chasm between Berta and Tom�s and the decisions that irreversibly change the course of the couple's fate. <i>Berta Isla</i> is a novel of love and truth, fear and secrecy, buried identities, and the destinies we bring upon ourselves.</p><p>JAVIER MAR�AS was born in Madrid in 1951.

Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Jull Costa.<b>I</b><br><br> For a while, she wasn&#x2019;t sure her husband was her husband, much as, when you&#x2019;re dozing, you&#x2019;re not sure whether you&#x2019;re thinking or dreaming, whether you&#x2019;re actually in charge of your own thoughts or have completely lost track of them out of sheer exhaustion. Sometimes she thought he was, sometimes not, and at other times, she decided to believe nothing and simply continue living her life with him, or with that man so similar to him, albeit older. But then she, too, had grown older in his absence; she was very young when they married.<br><br> Those other times were the best times, the calmest, gentlest, most satisfactory times, but they never lasted very long, it&#x2019;s not easy to shrug off such a doubt. She would manage to set it aside for weeks at a time and immerse herself in unconsidered daily life, which most of the Earth&#x2019;s inhabitants have no difficulty in enjoying, those who merely watch the days begin and see how they trace an arc as they pass and then end. Then they imagine there&#x2019;s some sort of closure, a pause, a division or a frontier, marked by falling asleep, but no such thing exists: time continues to advance and to work, not only on our body, but on our consciousness too, time doesn&#x2019;t care whether we&#x2019;re deep asleep or wide awake or unable to sleep at all or if our eyes unwittingly close as if we were raw recruits on night duty, what in Spanish we call <i>la imaginaria, </i>literally, something that exists only in the imagination, perhaps because, afterwards, to the person standing guard while the rest of the world sleeps, it does seem as if that period of time hadn&#x2019;t really happened&#x2014;always assuming the soldier did manage to stay awake and wasn&#x2019;t subsequently confined to barracks or, in time of war, executed. One irresistible slide into sleep and you find yourself dead, asleep for ever. How very danger�ous everything is.<br><br> When she believed that her husband was her husband, she felt less at ease and found it harder to get out of bed and begin the day, she felt a prisoner of what she had so long been waiting for and which had now happened and for which she no longer waited, because anyone who has grown used to waiting never entirely consents to that waiting coming to a close, it&#x2019;s like having half the air you breathe snatched from you. And when she believed that he wasn&#x2019;t her husband, then she would spend the night feeling agitated and guilty, and hope not to wake up so as not to have to face her own suspicions about him or the reproaches with which she chastised herself. She hated to see herself becoming this hard-hearted wretch. On the other hand, during the times when she decided, or was able, to believe nothing, she felt the lure of the hidden doubt, the post�poned uncertainty, which, sooner or later, would inevitably return. She had discovered how boring it was to live with absolute certainty and how it condemned you to just a single existence, or to experi�encing the real and the imaginary as one and the same, but then none of us ever quite escapes that. She discovered, too, that a state of permanent suspicion is equally unbearable, because it&#x2019;s exhaust�ing to be constantly observing yourself and others, especially if that other is the person closest to you, always comparing him with your memories of him, for memories can never be relied upon. No one can see clearly what is no longer there before them, even if it&#x2019;s only just happened, even if the aroma or discontent left behind by someone is still hanging there in the room. Someone only has to go through a door and disappear for their image to begin to fade, you only have to stop seeing something to stop seeing it clearly or at all; the same happens with hearing and, of course, with touch. How, then, can one remember clearly and in its proper sequence something that happened long ago? How could she faithfully recall the husband of fifteen or twenty years ago, the husband who, when she had already been asleep for a while, would slip into bed and, without a word, penetrate her? Maybe all these things vanish and blur, just as happens perhaps with those soldiers on night duty, <i>la imaginaria. </i>Perhaps they are precisely the things that fade most rapidly.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her simultaneously Spanish and English husband, Tom or Tom�s Nevinson by name, hadn&#x2019;t always been gripped by discontent. He hadn&#x2019;t always exuded a kind of&nbsp; all pervading irritation, a deep seated annoyance, which he dragged with him around the apartment, so that it managed to be both&nbsp; deep seated and superficial at the same time. It came with him into the living room, the bedroom, the kitchen, like an emanation, or as if it were a storm hanging over his head, following him everywhere and rarely leaving him. This caused him to be somewhat abrupt and to answer very few questions, regardless of whether these were compromising or entirely inoffensive. He took shelter from the first kind by saying that he was not authorised to reveal anything, always taking the opportunity to remind his wife, Berta Isla, that he never would be given such authorisation, that even if whole decades passed and he were about to die, he would never be able to tell her about his current exploits or his past assignments or missions, about the life he lived when he was away from her. Berta had to accept this and she did: there was a zone or a dimension of her husband that would remain for ever in darkness, always just beyond her field of vision and her hearing, the untold tale, the half closed or myopic or, rather, blind eye; a life she could only imagine or speculate about. <br><br> &#x201c;Besides, it&#x2019;s best you don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he told her on one occasion, for his enforced hermeticism did not prevent him from occasion-ally talking about it, in the abstract and without making any specific reference to places or individuals. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s often unpleasant, and contains some very sad stories, all doomed to end unhappily for one party or the other; sometimes it&#x2019;s amusing, but it&#x2019;s nearly always ugly or, worse, depressing. And I often emerge from it with a bad conscience. Fortunately, that soon passes, it doesn&#x2019;t last. And fortu�nately, too, I forget what I&#x2019;ve done, which is the advantage of such pretend situations, you&#x2019;re not the one experiencing it, or only as if you were an actor. Actors return to their own selves once the film or the play is over, and films and plays eventually fade. In the long term, they leave only a vague memory, as if they were something dreamed and improbable and definitely dubious. Or else are so out of keeping with yourself, that you think: &#x2018;No, I couldn&#x2019;t possibly have behaved like that, my memory&#x2019;s playing tricks on me, that was another me, it never happened.&#x2019; Or as if you were a sleepwalker unaware of what you did.&#x201d;<br><br> Berta Isla knew she was living partially with a stranger. And any�one who is barred from explaining whole months of his existence ends up feeling he has the right not to explain anything ever. On the other hand, Tom was, again partially, someone she had known all her life, someone she took as much for granted as the air she breathed. And no one interrogates the air.<br><br> They had known each other almost since they were children, when Tom�s Nevinson was cheerful and frivolous, and free of mists and shadows. The British Institute in Calle Mart�nez Campos&#x2014;next to the Museo Sorolla and where he had always studied&#x2014;abandoned or released its students when they were thirteen or fourteen, after the fourth year of baccalaureate. The fifth, sixth and pre- university years, the three years preceding university, had to be taken else�where, and quite a few students moved to Berta&#x2019;s school, the Studio, even if only because it was also co-educational and secular, which was not at all the norm in Franco&#x2019;s Spain, and because it meant not having to travel to a different neighbourhood, since the Studio was based in nearby Calle Miguel �ngel.<br><br> Unless they were completely hideous or dull as ditchwater, the &#x201c;new boys&#x201d; usually enjoyed great success with the opposite sex, precisely because they were &#x201c;new,&#x201d; and Berta soon fell primitively and obsessively in love with young Nevinson. There is much that is arbitrary and instinctive about such young loves, not to say aes�thetic or presumptuous (you look around and say to yourself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have him or her&#x201d;), loves that, inevitably, begin timidly, with shy glances, smiles and inconsequential conversations that nevertheless conceal a passion that instantly puts down roots and seems guaran�teed to last until the end of time. It is, of course, an entirely theoret�ical and untested passion, learned from novels and films, a fantasy in which a single image predominates: the girl imagines herself mar�ried to her chosen one and he to her, like a painting with no history, that never changes or develops, and the vision ends there, because both lack the ability to go any further, to see themselves at some remote age that does not concern them and which they fancy to be unreachable, or to imagine anything more than that culminating moment, beyond which everything is vague, everything stops; or which the more clear-sighted or stubborn see as consummation. In an age when it was expected that women, when they married, would add a &#x201c;de&#x201d; to their family name, followed by that of their husband, Berta was even influenced in her choice by the look and sound of her far-off future name: to become Berta Isla de Nevinson, so evoc�ative of adventures and exotic places (one day, she would have a business card on which precisely those names would appear, along�side who knows what other facts or titles), was simply not the same as becoming Berta Isla de Su�rez, the surname of the classmate she had liked until Tom turned up.<br><br> She wasn&#x2019;t the only girl in her class who had noticed Tom in that vehement, resolute way, and who nursed certain aspirations. Indeed, his arrival caused a general stir in the microcosmos, which lasted for two whole terms, until he was claimed by his rightful owner. Tom�s Nevinson was quite good-looking and somewhat taller than most of the other boys, he wore his fairish hair rather old-fashionedly combed back (like a bomber pilot from the 1940s, or like a railway worker when he wore it shorter, or a musician when he wore it longer, although never very long, contrary to the coming trend; for the benefit of the visually curious or those with a good memory, when his hair was short, he resembled the B-movie actor Dan Duryea, and, when it reached its maximum length, he resembled leading actor G�rard Philipe); and his whole person radiated the solidity of someone immune to fashion and, therefore, to the insecurities that, when you&#x2019;re fifteen, take so many forms, and from which almost no one escapes. He gave the impression of not being subject to the age he lived in, or of skimming over its sur�face, as if he cared nothing for chance circumstances, for example, the date you were born and even the century you were born into. His looks were, in fact, no more than agreeable, and he certainly wasn&#x2019;t an example of sublime youthful beauty; indeed, his looks bordered on the insipid, and would be undeniably so about twenty years later. For the moment, what saved them were his full, shapely lips (which made you feel like running a finger over them, touch�ing rather than kissing them) and his eyes, which were either a dull or a bright, tormented grey, depending on the light or the incipi�ent torment gathering within them: penetrating, restless eyes, and rather more almond-shaped than usual, eyes that rarely rested and that contradicted his otherwise serene appearance. You could sense something anomalous in those eyes or perhaps a warning of anom�alies to come, which were there crouched and watching, as if it were not yet their moment to wake and they needed to ripen or incubate in order to reach their full potency. His nose was undistinguished, rather broad and unfinished-looking or, rather, ending without a flourish. His chin was strong, almost square and slightly prominent, which gave him a determined air. It was the whole that was attrac�tive and charming, and what prevailed was not his appearance, but his frivolous, ironic personality, always ready with a sly quip, and as unconcerned with what was going on in the outside world as he was with what was happening inside his own head, which was never easy to divine, not by himself and certainly not by those close to him; Nevinson avoided introspection and spoke little about his own personality or beliefs, as if he thought both things childish and a waste of time. He was the very opposite of the adolescent discover�ing himself and analysing and observing and trying to understand himself, impatient to find out what kind of person he is, not realising that such inquiries are pointless because he is not yet complete and, besides, such knowledge does not come&#x2014;if it ever does, and is not constantly being modified and negated&#x2014;until he has to make some really difficult decisions and act on the spur of the moment, and when that happens, it&#x2019;s too late to change and be a different kind of person. Anyway, Tom�s Nevinson was not particularly interested in being known and certainly not interested in knowing himself, or perhaps he had already completed the latter process and con�sidered the former to be a job for narcissists. This could perhaps be attributed to his English ancestry, but, ultimately, no one really knew what he was like. Beneath his friendly, diaphanous, even affa�ble appearance there was a frontier of opacity and reserve. And the greatest opacity lay in the fact that others were unaware of that impenetrable layer or else barely noticed it.</p><h2>The American Angler&#39;s Book: Embracing the Natural History of Sporting Fish, and the Art of Taking Them</h2><p>Over one and a half centuries after its original publication, Thaddeus Norris&#x2019;s <i>The American Angler&#x2019;s Book</i> remains a classic heavily sought after by fishing enthusiasts and collectors.

She is adjusting, too, to aging ("The knowledge that her beauty was lost had come upon her recently and it was still occasionally forgotten.")

Wright won the James Beard/KitchenAid Cookbook of the Year award and the James Beard Award for the Best Writing on Food in 2000 for A Mediterranean Feast (William Morrow), which was also a finalist for the International Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) Cookbook of the Year award that same year. He is the author of fourteen books, twelve of which are cookbooks. Wright's articles on food and cuisine have appeared in Gourmet, Bon App\u00e9tit, Food &amp; Wine, Saveur, and other magazines. He is a contributing editor to ZesterDaily.com. As an independent researcher, Wright wrote the food entries for Columbia University's Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and has published scholarly articles on food in peer-reviewed journals such as Al-Masaq: Islam and the Medieval Mediterranean, Food and Foodways, and Gastronomica. Wright has also lectured on food at the Center for European Studies at Harvard University, Boston University, Georgetown University, Davidson College in North Carolina, Loyola Marymount University, South Dakota State University, University of California at Santa Barbara, and the Culinary Institute of America, among other institutions. As a cooking teacher, he has taught cooking classes at the Central Market cooking schools in Texas, the Rhode Island School of Design, Institute for Culinary Education in New York, Sur la Table, and other cooking schools around the United States. His website www.CliffordAWright.com is one of the most-visited sites for people interested in Mediterranean foods. In 2009 he launched the Venice Cooking School (www.VeniceCookingSchool.com) with Martha Rose Shulman in Los Angeles, California. He lives in Santa Monica, California.Wright continues his exploration of the Mediterranean region (after Mediterranean Vegetables and A Mediterranean Feast) with this investigation of tapas, antipasti, meze and whatever else one might call small dishes that start a meal. The recipes-and there are a generous 500 included-are uniformly excellent, but sometimes Wright's commitment to authenticity leads to too much exotica (Curried Cucumber and Lamb Tongue Skewers, Vols-au-Vent Stuffed with Veal Sweetbreads and Black Truffles), with too little space dedicated to clever but more accessible tidbits such as Spinach with Garlic Yogurt on Fried Arabic Bread and Rolled Yogurt Balls. Numerous recipes, such as Tunisian Lamb, Brain, and Fried Potato Frittata with Cheeses and Baby Octopus in Piquant Sauce call for hard-to-locate ingredients. Chapters are organized by type of dish, with two chapters dedicated to fried foods: the one on fried turnovers opens with four recipes for briks (North African pastries). Another chapter on cheese-based foods (despite Wright's earlier insistence that cheese "is too rich and heavy" to make a good starter) includes Taleggio Cheese and Buckwheat Flour Fritters from Lombardy. Although Wright provides copious information in headnotes and sidebars, there is one integral thing lacking. A long list of menus for parties of various types and an introduction that details the history of eating small dishes before a larger meal are helpful, but there is no indication of how to figure portion sizes when serving items such as Pizza Margherita, Stockfish, Fava Bean, and Potato Stew from Liguria and Polenta with Porcini Mushrooms as entrees.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Billionaire Secrets to Success</h2><p>There have been plenty of books written on the topic of Success &amp; Failure. This book is remarkably different from all the rest. Billionaire Secrets of Success is the first success and failure book written by a person who has personally experienced being a millionaire three times, being bankrupt twice, and being a billionaire once. Bill's successes have been the subject of more than 470 news articles in publications ranging from Forbes, Fortune, BusinessWeek, Inc., People, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today. The author's unique journey from poverty to being the twenty-fifth wealthiest person in America, with several ups and downs along the way, has given him an amazingly unique perspective from which to share his experiences and the lessons he learned. He shares with the reader his nine principles for attaining success. These nine principles are not the product of some academic conclusion. Bill has personally tested these nine principles, not once, not twice, not three times, but four times over the past twenty five years . . . and they have worked every time. These nine principles work for all, no matter education, social status, financial situation, or how many times they failed in the past. Here is what these nine principles did for him, and they can do the same thing for anyone: FROM? ? TO Poverty and welfare? ? 25th wealthiest person in America High school dropout? ? Permanent place in the Smithsonian Institute Working at traveling carnival? ? National Entrepreneur of the Year Gang member ? ? Case study by Harvard Business School Minimum wage? ? $100 million annual income Riding the bus? ? His own personal $25 million jet Homeless? ? $2 million, 12,000 square foot home Drawing unemployment? ? Employing 4,000 Million dollars in debt? ? Billionaire Bill's book is also unique in that it explains in plain language the mechanics of the mental processes that guarantee our success or our failure. Once you understands how these processes work, you can begin to change your life. It is not too late! No matter where you are or what you have done or failed to do . . . you can become the person you deserve to be!

His thrillers are set in motion by suppressed guilt, sexual frustrations, explosions of violence, and the inaccessible nature of intimacy. Extremely valuable is a gangster-infested urban setting. Uniquely, Goodis saw a still-vibrant community solidarity down there. Another contribution was sympathy for the gang boss, doomed by his very success. He dramatizes all this in the stark language of the Philadelphia&#x2019;s &#x201c;streets of no return.&#x201d; <br><br>The book delineates the noir profundity of the author&#x2019;s work in the context of Franz Kafka&#x2019;s narratives. Goodis&#x2019; precise sense of place, and painful insights about the indomitability of fate, parallel Kafka&#x2019;s. Both writers mix realism, the disorienting, and the dreamlike; both dwell on obsession and entrapment; both describe the protagonist&#x2019;s degeneration. Tragically, belief in obligations, especially family ones, keep independence out of reach. <br><br>Other elements covered in this critical analysis of Goodis&#x2019;s work include his Hollywood script-writing career; his use of Freud, Arthur Miller, Faulkner and Hemingway; his obsession with incest; and his &#x201c;noble loser&#x2019;s&#x201d; indomitable perseverance. <br><br>Praise for PULP ACCORDING TO DAVID GOODIS: <br><br>&#x201c;This was a fascinating read. [Gertzman] appears as an expert not only on Goodis&#x2019;s body of work but on the pulp era of fiction in general, mid-twentieth-century American history, Philadelphia history, literary analysis, and a litany of other subjects. The book is stylishly written and well designed for reaching a broader, nonacademic audience interested in the pulp&#x2019;s history, role in American culture, and meaning.

So, when she gets word of a possible case, she sneaks back into the city to squeeze in a little more sleuthing before the wedding bells can ring.</p><p>A wealthy Chinese immigrant wants her to find his missing bride, and Molly---sure she isn't getting the whole story---suspects that his bride ran off. But where could she go?

With &#34;an appeal that crosses racial boundaries&#34; (Entertainment Weekly), Chris Rock&#39;s book &#34;crawls into the minds of the lazy, women, blacks, and whites, uncovering driving forces that are all too real in modern society&#34; (Variety).</p><p><i>Rock This</i> reads like a collection of Chris Rock's routines, and that's the book's only flaw. A little more of Rock himself would be nice--maybe something that's a cross between an autobiography and Rock's routine transcribed for print. That said, <i>Rock This</i> is a very funny book. The young comedian speaks his mind about a variety of topics: race, sex, drugs, O. J. Simpson, and relationships between men and women. Occasionally profane and wrong-headed, most of the time Rock's wry observations--his assessments of the Reverend Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jesse Jackson are dead-on--make you nod your head in acknowledgment of their truth, even as you shake with laughter.<strong>Chris Rock</strong> grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, and has been performing stand-up comedy for more than twelve years. Rock made his film debut in <em>Beverly Hills Cops II</em>; went on to star in <em>CB4</em>, <em>New Jack City</em>, and <em>Boomerang</em>, among others; and spent three years on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. Nowadays, Rock can be seen in commercials for 1-800-COLLECT and is the voice of "Little Penny" in commercials for Nike. But he broke new ground with his coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign for <em>Politically Incorrect</em> and with his award-winning HBO specials, <em>Chris Rock: Big-Ass Jokes</em> and <em>Bring the Pain</em>, which led to his current late-night HBO show, <em>The Chris Rock Show</em>. His latest comedy album, <em>Roll with the New</em>, was released in 1997, and Rock continues to perform concerts each year to sold-out crowds throughout the country. He still lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p><h2>Consciousness in Transition: Metaphysical Notes</h2><p>This is the second book in the trilogy of books compiled from Joel Goldsmith s lecture series. The trilogy includes Rising in Consciousness, Consciousness in Transition, and Consciousness Transformed. Rising in Consciousness and Consciousness in Transition illuminate Goldsmith s early class work. Consciousness Transformed comes from a lecture series given during the last years of his work. Together the trilogy presents a holistic overview of a living message. <br><br>Soon after the publication in 1947 of Goldsmith s first book, The Infinite Way, Goldsmith gave a series of lectures in San Francisco to students who had requested instruction. These classes set the foundation for what was to become a worldwide teaching ministry. They laid out a framework of spiritual principles of such integrity and purity that students of sufficient intent and motivation who worked with them could experience illumination. These classes were recorded on a wire recorder and transcribed for students. Later they were put into a book called Metaphysical Notes. <br><br>Consciousness in Transition is the second book derived from Metaphysical Notes, and it continues the class work covered in Rising in Consciousness. In Consciousness in Transition, Goldsmith goes into depth on living, moving, and having one's being in spiritual consciousness. He continues the explanation of the path of spiritual growth and lays the foundation necessary for attaining conscious union with God. The reader can virtually sit in on Joel s early class work and learn about the practices of meditation, healing and treatment, and prayer, and understand the nature of God and the nature of error.</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The InfiniteWay,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;</p><h2>In tearing haste: letters between Deborah Devonshire and Patrick Leigh Fermor</h2><p>In Tearing Haste: Letters Between Deborah Devonshire and Patrick Leigh Fermor</p><p>DEBORAH DEVONSHIRE<br> The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire was brought up in Oxfordshire with spells in London. In 1950 her husband, Andrew, the 11th Duke of Devonshire, inherited estates in Yorkshire and Ireland, as well as Chatsworth, the family seat in Derbyshire, and Deborah became chatelaine and housekeeper of one of England&#x2019;s greatest and best-loved houses. Following her husband&#x2019;s death in 2004, she moved to a village on the Chatsworth Estate where she now lives.<br> PATRICK LEIGH FERMOR<br> Patrick Leigh Fermor is of English and Irish descent. After his stormy schooldays, followed by his walk across Europe to Constantinople, he lived and travelled in the Balkans and the Greek Archipelago, acquiring a deep interest in languages and remote places. He joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, fought in Greece and Crete where, during the German occupation, he returned three times. Disguised as a shepherd he lived for over two years in the mountains, organising the resistance, and led the party that captured and evacuated the German commander, General Kreipe. He was awarded the DSO and OBE, and made Honorary Citizen of Heraklion, and later of Kardamyli and Gytheion.

At the same time, the book's title, a phrase deriving from Leigh Fermor's habit of dashing off messages 'with a foot in the stirrup,' captures the vigor and bustle of the lives that nourished the correspondence....<i>In Tearing Haste</i> is engaging from start to finish. There isn't a dull letter among Charlotte Mosley's selections. Even her annotations, often incorporating information from the book's two correspondents, are as surprising as they are informative....More than anything else, the collection is important as an addition to Leigh Fermor's body of work, both because his letters constitute a larger portion of the volume and because the writing in them harmonizes with the books that established his literary reputation." --<i>The Nation</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a book that evokes a lost world of glamour, intelligence and personal scruples.

His central theory concentrates on the value he places on self interest, arguing that it is not from the &#34;benevolence&#34; of others that we receive what we need but out of their regard for their own self interest. When each person pursues his or her own self-interest, society as a whole is led to a condition of benefit for all. The pure experiments in this approach, laissez-faire economics, was seen to fail in the industrial misery of Charles Dickens&#39; England and in the United States in the financial scandals of the trusts and cartels and the economic booms and busts that eventually led to the Great Depression. Could Adam Smith have made a mistake, a mistake that still colours the core of modern life? This book argues that he did. Dr Lux argues that self-interest does not lead to a good society, but instead to social strife, ecological damage and abuse of power. Another principle must exist to moderate self-interest and it is one that goes by many names. Dr Lux argues that we have been mislead by economics into calling selfishness and greed a good thing. Instead this book argues that good only comes out of good. With the adequate recognition of this mistake we, as a society, will be able to move forward into a time where selfishness can no longer hide under a protective cover of economic justification.</p><p>The coauthor of Humanistic Economics (Boostrap Pr., 1988) asserts that, by enshrining self-interest as the core of economics, Smith mistakenly detoured the discipline into a moral dead end. He points to the abuses of the Industrial Revolution in England and the rise of the socially irresponsible "robber barons" in the United States as examples of the ethical void at the heart of the laissez-faire philosophy. After examining Smith and his critics, Lux attempts to demonstrate the benefits of benevolence in economic relationships. Confined primarily to pre-20th century examples and authors, the volume is somewhat limited in scope and selective in interpretation. Still, it can be recommended as an example of the humanistic critique of conventional economics.<br><i>- Richard C.

Robert Oppenheimer, Paul Dirac, and Steven Weinberg, many of whom he knew personally, as well as Winston Churchill&#x2019;s pursuit of nuclear weapons for Britain and Wernher von Braun&#x2019;s pursuit of rockets for space travel. And he takes a provocative, often politically incorrect approach to some of today&#x2019;s most controversial scientific issues: global warming, the current calculations of which he thinks are probably wrong; the future of biotechnology, which he expects to dominate our lives in the next half-century as the tools to design new living creatures become available to everyone; and the flood of information in the digital age. Dyson offers fresh perspectives on the history, the philosophy, and the practice of scientific inquiry&#x2014;and even on the blunders, the wild guesses and wrong theories that are also part of our struggle to understand the wonders of the natural world.</p></p><p><b>Freeman Dyson</b> has spent most of his life as a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, taking time off to advise the US government and write books for the general public. He was born in England and worked as a civilian scientist for the Royal Air Force during World War II. He came to Cornell University as a graduate student in 1947 and worked with Hans Bethe and Richard Feynman, producing a user-friendly way to calculate the behavior of atoms and radiation. He also worked on nuclear reactors, solid-state physics, ferromagnetism, astrophysics, and biology, looking for problems where elegant mathematics could be usefully applied.<br><br>Dyson&#x2019;s books include&nbsp;<i>Disturbing the Universe&nbsp;</i>(1979),&nbsp;<i>Weapons and Hope</i>&nbsp;(1984),&nbsp;<i>Infinite in All Directions</i>&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;<i>Origins of Life</i>&nbsp;(1986, second edition 1999),&nbsp;<i>The Sun, the Genome and the Internet&nbsp;</i>(1999), <i>The Scientist as Rebel&nbsp;</i>(2006, published by New York Review Books), and&nbsp;<i>A Many-Colored Glass: Reflections on the Place of Life in the Universe</i>&nbsp;(2010).

With unimpeded access to the young performer, Wertheimer was able to capture the unguarded and everyday moments in Elvis' life during that crucial year, a year that took him from Tupelo, Mississippi to the silver screen, and to the verge of international stardom and his crowning as "The King of Rock 'n' Roll.&#x201d; As Alfred Wertheimer photographed Elvis during 1956, and again in 1958, he created classic images that are spontaneous, unrehearsed and completely without artifice.<br><br> Wertheimer&#x2019;s photographs of Elvis are extraordinary and he appears almost ethereal, whether reading a newspaper while waiting for a cab, or washing his hands during one of his many train trips. After 1958 and Elvis&#x2019; induction into the army, the world seemingly forgot about Wertheimer&#x2019;s magical photographs - for nineteen years - until Aug 16, 1977, the day Elvis died and <i>Time</i> Magazine called. &#x201c;The phone hasn&#x2019;t really stopped ringing in the last thirty years,&#x201d; observes Wertheimer.<br><br> Many of the photographs in this visual treasury are previously unpublished and some have become almost as famous as the man himself.</p><p><p>Alfred Wertheimer was born in Germany in 1930, came to America and settled in Brooklyn as a young boy. He took an early interest in architecture and design, which led him to Cooper Union, from which he graduated in 1951. In the spring of 1956, a series of commercial assignments for RCA Records led to a shoot of a newly signed singer named Elvis Presley. Instantly impressed, Wertheimer devoted four months of his own time to intensely shadow the young star. The result would be the most intimate and candid look at the future legend ever recorded.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter Guralnick is an award-winning biographer of Elvis Presley and author of&nbsp;Last Train to Memphis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Careless Love. A music critic, screenwriter, and historian of American popular music, he is also the author of&nbsp;Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke.</p></p><h2>Storm: 1798-1800 (The Great Awakenings Series #3)</h2><p><b>A storm of rebellion is gathering, and its dark clouds overshadow Yale College.</b> <br> <br> First-year student Asa Rush isn't surprised that he's one of a handful of Christians on campus. After all, he's been recruited by President Timothy Dwight to help bring revival to the school. Once a bastion of faith, Yale is now a hotbed of atheism, following on the tails of the popular French revolution. <br> <br> But fellow student Eli Cooper is determined to make Asa's life miserable -- especially when both men fall in love with the sensuous, wealthy, and mysterious Annabelle Byrd. Just when Asa thinks things can't get worse, Dr. Dwight charges Asa with a shocking commission that shakes him to the core. <br> <br> As America, barely two decades old, faces its first divisive presidential election, voters arm themselves in anticipation of the outcome. Asa and Eli are caught in the eye of the storm. Is the battle political or spiritual? Will the nation choose revolution or revival? And when the winds subside, who will be left standing? <br> <br> Inspired by actual revival events, this third book in a series of four explores the personal and spiritual upheaval that occurs when the Holy Spirit stirs the waters of our souls.</p><p>As the spiritual fervor of the Great Awakening begins to decline in America, a young student at Yale College becomes the target of both academic and personal attacks as he takes a stand for his faith. In time, he discovers that this is no coincidence but rather the work of a secret society bent on squelching a spiritual revival that breaks out on campus. Written with the intensity of a political thriller, this compelling novel-set against the historical backdrop of America in the late 1800s-reminds readers how the Holy Spirit can shape not only individual lives, but an entire nation.The late <b>Bill Bright</b> was founder and chairman of Campus Crusade for Christ International.

All Souls, narrated by a visiting Spanish lecturer, is a book he swears to be fiction, but which its &#34;characters&#34; -- the real-life dons and professors and bookshop owners who have &#34;recognized&#34; &#34;themselves&#34; -- fiercely maintain to be a roman a clef. They claim certain roles for their own, and for others: the narrator&#39;s invented mistress has been firmly identified as one of the professors&#39; wives. Marias views with astonishment a world that seemed nearly asleep set into fretful motion by a world that never &#34;existed&#34;. Yet this backwash of All Souls only begins an odyssey into the nature of identity (&#34;We do not know anyone entirely, not even ourselves&#34;), and of time (&#34;which is not yet past nor lost and maybe isn&#39;t even time at all&#34;). With the flair of Sterne, his &#34;false&#34; novel manipulates time, weaving in autobiography, a legendary kingdom, strange ghostly literary figures, halls of mirrors, a one-eyed WWI veteran, a curse in Havana and a bullet lost in Mexico. Dark Back of Time becomes a brilliant ironic puzzle about the powers of art and of memories, which become only more mysterious the more Marias remembers.</p><p>Javier Marias is an award-winning Spanish novelist. He is also a translator and columnist, as well as the current king of Redonda. He was born in Madrid in 1951 and published his first novel at the age of nineteen. He has held academic posts in Spain, the US (he was a visiting professor at Wellesley College) and Britain, as a lecturer in Spanish Literature at Oxford University. He has been translated into 34 languages, and more than six million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. In 1997 he won the Nelly Sachs Award; the Comunidad de Madrid award in 1998; in 2000 the Grinzane Cavour Award, the Alberto Moravia Prize, and the Dublin IMPAC Award. He also won the Spanish National Translation Award in 1979 for his translation of Tristram Shandy in 1979. He was a professor at Oxford University and the Complutense of Madrid. He currently lives in Madrid.<br><br>Esther Allen has translated Javier Marias, Jorge Luis Borges, Felisberto Hernandez, Flaubert, Rosario Castellanos, Blaise Cendrars, Marie Darrieussecq, and Jose Marti. She is currently a professor at Baruch College (CUNY) and has directed the work of the PEN Translation Fund since its founding in 2003. Allen has received a Fulbright Grant (1989), a National Endowment for the Arts Translation Fellowship (1995), and was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters (2006).The Spanish novelist Javier Mar�as has the ability, which he shares with Italo Calvino, to turn a metaphysical insight into a novelistic adventure. In his latest book, Mar�as employs the old gambit of a novel within a novel, but the radical twist is that the novel on the inside is one of Mar�as's real, previous novels All Souls. All Souls revolved around various fictitious and nonfictitious Oxford personalities, and was inspired by Mar�as's temporary teaching position at the university in the early '80s. In the present novel, Mar�as learns, to his dismay, that various factual Oxford personages upon whom various fictional personages were based are taking over his novel, in effect, by extrapolating fictitious facts from partial facts that were embedded in the original fiction. For instance, the fictitious narrator of All Souls has an affair with a married woman, Clare Bayes. This is translated, in the Oxford community, as proof that the real Mar�as had a real affair with a woman at Oxford, who is variously identified. Other misidentifications and misreadings follow. In one of the funniest scenes, Mar�as returns to an antiquarian bookstore in Oxford and finds that the couple who own it, the Stones, not only identify with the bookstore-owning Alabasters in his novel, but want to play them in the film version of the book. Meanwhile, the film, in a final turn of the screw, turns out to be a complete distortion of the novel. The second half of this novel is a virtuoso digression on the seedily adventurous circle around a minor British poet and Oxford figure, Gawsworth. Mar�as has an antiquarian's taste for history's minor characters, in whose lives fact flows easily into fiction and back again. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Beneath The American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagination in the Age of Emerson and Melville</h2><p>Analyses American literature from the first half of the nineteenth century, including many lesser known works, and discusses writings of various geographical regions and both sexes</p><p><b>David S. Reynolds</b> is Professor of English at the Graduate School and Baruch College, City University of New York.Using the products of popular culture between 1820 and 1855 more comprehensively than do other Renaissance scholars, Reynolds tries to fix our "classic" texts (e.g., Moby Dick ) as culminating transfigurations of, rather than anomalous reactions against, the voluminous literature of their day. He focuses especially on the various reform literatures, new religious evangelical style, and flood of popular fiction, arguing that our major writers were able to absorb the style, themes, and genres of these sub-literary materials without sacrificing aesthetic control. Though he tends to overstate specific influences and embraces too mechanical a model for the creative process, his argument and impressive display of materials make for a significant contribution to American studies.

Henry provided an embarrassment of riches for the compilers of this volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final selection of the thirty-eight stories in this collection offers for the reader's delight those tales honored almost unanimously by anthologists and those that represent, in variety and balance, the best work of America's favorite storyteller.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are tales in his most mellow, humorous, and ironic moods.&nbsp;&nbsp;They give the full range and flavor of the man born William Sydney Porter but known throughout the world as O. Henry, one of the great masters of the short story.</p><p>&#34;Such tales as &#39;A Municipal Report,&#39; &#39;An Unfinished Story,&#39; &#39;A Blackjack Bargainer,&#39; &#39;A Lickpenny Lover,&#39; &#39;The Gift of the Magi,&#39; &#39;Mammon and the Archer,&#39; and &#39;Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen&#39; (by actual count the O.

As in the previous volumes, which include the 1993 National Book Award-winning <i>United States: Essays 1952-1992</i>, Vidal displays unparalleled range and inimitable style as he deals with matters literary, historical, personal, and political. There are warm (and shrewd) appreciations of Edmund Wilson, Dawn Powell, Sinclair Lewis, and Mark Twain; polemical observations on the major figures and (as he sees it) deplorable developments in American politics, Bill Clinton, FDR, JFK, his cousin Al Gore, the CIA and the American empire, the global reach of media conglomerates, and the United States' disdain for the UN, as well as fascinating autobiographical vignettes. Pieces that have already generated shock waves include his essay in dispraise of the works of John Updike, his controversial defense of Charles Lindbergh, and his attack on the national security state that first appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Nobody makes the fur fly in a more elegant and civilized fashion than Gore Vidal. He is our indispensable man.</p><p>"The American tradition of independent and curious learning is kept alive in the wit and great expressiveness of Gore Vidal's criticism."<br>--Citation for the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism <br><br>Praise for Gore Vidal's Previous Essay Collection,<i> United States:<br><br></i>"In 114 essays written over a period of forty years, Gore Vidal has shown himself to be a masterly, learned, and percipient observer of an unparalleled range of subjects. <i>United States: Essays 1952-1992 </i>assesses such diverse matters as modern French fiction, the Kennedys, underappreciated writers like Thomas Love Peacock, and the American attitude toward sex. He writes tenderly of authors and people he cherishes Eleanor Roosevelt, Tennessee Williams, William Dean Howells. Whatever his subject, he addresses it with an artist's resonant appreciation, a scholar's conscience, and the persuasive powers of a great essayist." <br>--Citation for the 1993 National Book Award<br><br>"Gore Vidal, essayist; so good that we cannot do without him.

Zentangle quilting = filling odd shaped spaces with repetitive patterns using machine stitches and thread. Free-motion quilting in repetitive patterns is not new to quilters. They have long used stitch patterns like "vermicelli" and "echo" stitching to quilt their projects. <i>Tangle Stitches for Quilters and Fabric Artists</i> takes the concepts, theory and method of Zentangle and transfer them into quilting patterns and projects. You will learn how to create tangle patterns on paper and then how to create the same patterns in thread, the key difference being that Zentangle patterns on paper are 'one stroke at a time' while quilting patterns are most efficiently achieved in one continuous line. Zentangle-inspired quilting projects include materials, how to mark and prepare fabric, tricks and tools. The projects can be achieved on either a domestic (conventional sit-down) sewing machine or longarm quilting machine.</p></p><p><p><b>Jane Monk</b> lives in Tasmania, Australia.

She has taught numerous classes in Zentangle, quilting, free-motion stitching, making journal covers, and doll making.</p><p>"Jane Monk is the teacher we all wish we had growing up, in that whatever the challenging subject, she would inspire us to master it. With her new book, <i>Tangle Stitches: For Quilters and Fabric Artists</i>, you''ll feel as if Jane is sitting down with you for a tutoring session on stitching. Quilters generally fall into 2 categories, those who get more joy from creating the tops and those where stitching is the supreme motivator.

The book examines their complex and time-consuming manufacture and the varied repertoire of effects employed by the weavers and dyers of 18th- and 19th-century Japan.

But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorHOW CAN ONE GIRL SAVE AN ENTIRE WORLD? <br>To the nobles who live in Benden Weyr, Lessa is nothing but a ragged kitchen girl.

But this profusely illustrated guide is packed with information, creating a real "visual dictionary" of herbal remedies. While most such guides mention terms like infusions, decoctions, tinctures, compresses, and ointments, this book uses excellent photographs to reveal the actual process of preparing them. Equally detailed illustrations track herbs through their stages of growth and preservation. There is clear instruction here on the harvesting, preparation, and therapeutic properties of 60 herbs, with particular attention given to specific ailments and the needs of people at different stages of life. The A to Z Guide to Healing Herbal Remedies covers much of the same material, but in a quick reference format and without illustrations. The focus is different: this book lists herbs that are already prepared in the form of capsules, teas, extracts, oils, and tinctures and are commercially available in drugstores and supermarkets. There are two listings, one by ailment, one by herb, with coverage of dosage, benefits, precautions, and preventative and curative functions. These two books complement each other in purpose and information presented; much of the content is not repetitive (e.g., Ody covers bedwetting, while Elias and Masline cover AIDS; Ody lists herbs alphabetically by botanical name and Elias and Masline by common name). A library would do well to have several books on herbal medicine. Ody's is essential for libraries having no illustrated herbal books; Elias and Masline's meets the needs of patrons interested in convenience rather than the painstaking preparation of herbs.<br><i>Valerie Vaughan, Hatfield P.L., Mass.</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On Duty With The Queen</h2><p>Dickie Arbiter was the Press Officer for Buckingham Palace for 12 years.

This book recounts the tale of how the Prize was won. It also describes some of the subsequent work done by Rubbia and his group during the middle 1980s. From Taubes's description we come to see this scientist as a thoroughly unpleasant person, obsessed by the need to be best. He terrorizes his subordinates and co-workers and lies to his peers. Most disheartening is that he is interested only in publishing first and exhibits little patience for the kind of meticulous attention to detail that guarantees the accuracy of his results. If Taubes's account is true, then the quest for the Nobel Prize may be doing more harm than good to the cause of scientific progress.Harold D.

This book is both a study of his art and an argument for fuller recognition of the peculiarities of the painter's representational medium.<br>Alpers and Baxandall locate distinctive modes of Tiepolo's representation of the world and human action; follow his process of invention from first pen drawings, through small oil sketches, to great frescoes; and analyse his best and biggest painting, the Four Continents in the Stairway Hall of the Prince-Bishop's Residence at Wurzburg, illustrated with photographs specially taken for the book.<br>The topics taken up include: painting's resistance to enacted narrative drama, its engagement with indeterminacies and repetitions, the senses in which a painter may 'perform' both past art and himself, the constructive roles of gestural drawing, exploitation of shifts of scale between design and finished work, dialogue between the changing natural site lighting and in-picture lighting, contributions made by the beholder's own mobility, the expressive scope of tensions between two and three dimensions, the deep rationale of rococo formal structure, and the sources of the moral force of pictures without an explicit moral.<br>The book - both art criticism and a practical polemic - ends with an annotated gazetteer for travellers, listing those Tiepolo paintings that can still be seen in the places and conditions for which he painted them.</p><p>Svetlana Alpers is professor of the history of art at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>Nat King Cole</h2><p>The first major biography of the great jazz pianist and singer, written with the full cooperation of his family.<br><br>When he died in 1965, at age forty-five, Nat King Cole was already a musical legend. As famous as Frank Sinatra, he had sold more records than anyone but Bing Crosby.<br>Written with the narrative pacing of a novel, this absorbing biography traces Cole's rise to fame, from boy-wonder jazz genius to megastar in a racist society. Daniel Mark Epstein brings Cole and his times to vivid life: his precocious entrance onto the vibrant jazz scene of his hometown, Chicago; the creation of his trio and their rise to fame; the crossover success of such songs as "Straighten Up and Fly Right"; and his years as a pop singer and television star, the first African American to have his own show.<br>Epstein examines Cole's insistence on changing society through his art rather than political activism, the romantic love story of Cole and Maria Ellington, and Cole's famous and influential image of calm, poise, and elegance, which concealed the personal turmoil and anxiety that undermined his health.<br></p><p>Pianist/vocalist Nat King Cole made everything look easy. His warm and haunting tenor voice, suave demeanor, and elegant piano style influenced dozen of singers and instrumentalists, including Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, and Diana Krall. But as Daniel Mark Epstein unveils in this illuminating biography, it took years of dues-paying for Cole to reach superstardom. With prose that reads like Cole's lyrical phrasings, Epstein takes the reader through the eventful places and spaces of the artist's life: from his birth in Alabama in 1919, his family's turbulent move to Chicago, and his rise as an Earl Hines-influenced teen jazz sensation, to the formation of his famous piano-guitar-bass trio in the '40s.<p> Epstein doesn't shy away from the lows, describing the anguish Cole caused his preacher father, the failed first marriage, tax and health problems, sibling rivalry, and the jealousy that destroyed his combo when Cole made the transition from jazz artist to pop singer. But these are balanced with the highs, like the tremendous success of Cole's vocal hits "Straighten Up And Fly Right" "Route 66," "Mona Lisa," and "The Christmas Song," and his second marriage to Maria Ellington. Epstein also cites Cole's quiet battles on the Civil Rights front. He purchased a home in an exclusive, all white Los Angeles neighborhood; insisted on performing for integrated audiences in the south and heroically survived a vicious racial attack during a Birmingham concert in 1956. "Nat King Cole was not a political philosopher schooled in rhetoric or the dialectics of history," the author writes. "He was a clear thinker with sound instincts and compassion.... Where he had gone--to riches, fame, and honor--he hoped his brothers and sisters would soon follow." By he time died of lung cancer in 1965, his artistry had left its mark on the 20th century and on everyone who loved him. As Epstein summarizes, "[H]e paid attention to his friends, his children, his sideman, his audiences and most of all his music." <i>--Eugene Holley, Jr.</i></p>When he died in 1965, at age forty-five, Nat King Cole was already a musical legend. As famous as Frank Sinatra, he had sold more records than anyone but Bing Crosby. Written with the narrative pacing of a novel, this absorbing biography traces Cole&#39;s rise to fame, from boy-wonder jazz genius to megastar in a racist society. Daniel Mark Epstein brings Cole and his times to vivid life: his precocious entrance onto the vibrant jazz scene of his hometown, Chicago; the creation of his Trio and their rise to fame; the crossover success of such songs as &#34;Straighten Up and Fly Right&#34;; and his years as a pop singer and television star, the first African-American to have his own show. Epstein examines Cole&#39;s insistence on changing society through his art rather than political activism, the romantic love story of Cole and Maria Ellington, and Cole&#39;s famous and influential image of calm, poise, and elegance, which concealed the personal turmoil and anxiety that undermined his health.</p><h2>Desert Dog</h2><p>Tawny, a racing greyhound, yearns for the freedom of the wide open spaces, but he must learn the ways of the wild before he can cope with desert life</p><p></p><h2>The Wyrmling Horde</h2><p>Review<br>"David Farland has written a series that rivals the best of Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind and Orson Scott Card."<br>--SF Revu on Worldbinder<br><br>"Brings the saga's conflicts to a resounding climax in a three-cornered confrontation. . . .

Time to check them out. Frank Fr�lich skipped down the last two steps, went through the gateway, past the two men and out into the street. They didn&#x2019;t react. He thought: They should have reacted. Why didn&#x2019;t they react? He shoved his hands deep into his jacket pockets and with lowered eyes continued walking. In the window of the fishmonger&#x2019;s, a man was shovelling ice into a polystyrene box. He shot a quick glance back over his shoulder. Neither of the men was taking any notice. They were still fidgeting with their rosary beads. One of them said something and both burst into laughter.<br>A rusty cycle stand creaked. A woman was pushing her bicycle into it. She walked past the boxes of vegetables on display. She opened the door to Badir&#x2019;s shop. The bell over the door jingled. The door closed behind her.<br>Frank Fr�lich felt as though some wild beast were gnawing at his stomach: a customer in the shop? Uh-oh. That wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen at all.<br>He leapt into the road. A car braked sharply. The car behind hooted its horn and almost crashed into it. Frank Fr�lich ran up the pavement. He passed the bicycle, the boxes of mushrooms, grapes, lettuce and peppers &#x2013; went through the door into the shop, which smelt like a rotten-apple cellar with the added sickly-sweet odour of oil.<br>The woman was alone in the shop. She had a shopping basket hung over her arm and was walking slowly between two lines of food shelves. There was no one else in sight. No one was sitting by the cash till. The curtain in the doorway behind the cash machine flapped gently.<br>The woman was short in stature. Her black hair was gathered at the back of her head. She was wearing jeans and a cut-off jacket. A small rucksack swung from her shoulder. Black gloves on her hands, fingers clutching a tin can. She was reading the label.<br>Frank Fr�lich was two metres away when it happened. He glanced to his left. Through the shop window he saw the police car on the other side of the street. They had started.<br>Suddenly he launched himself at her and dragged her down with him. Half a second later there was a screech of brakes. The man who sprang across the counter was one of the two with the rosary beads. Now he was holding a gun. A shot was fired. There was a jangle of broken glass. The display case containing tobacco and cigarettes tipped over. Another shot was fired. And then chaos. Sirens. Barking voices. Clattering heels. The noise of a door and glass breaking, shattering in a never-ending stream. The woman lay still beneath him. Cigarette packets showered down onto them. She was probably around thirty years of age, smelling of perfume. Her blue eyes glinted like sapphires. Finally Frank Fr�lich managed to tear his eyes away. Then he discovered her hands. Fascinated, he lay watching them industriously working away. Long fingers clad in leather, small hands automatically stuffing packets of cigarettes into her rucksack, which had come loose in the fall. Then he became aware of the silence. There was a draught from the door and window.<br>&#x2018;Fr�lich?&#x2019; The voice came from a megaphone.<br>&#x2018;Here!&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Is the woman all right?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re a policeman,&#x2019; the woman whispered. She cleared her throat to speak.<br>He nodded and finally let her go.<br>&#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t be a smart idea to pinch anything then?&#x2019;<br>He shook his head, fascinated yet again by how efficiently the small hands took the cigarettes out of the rucksack. He rose to his knees.<br>They stood there looking at each other. She was attractive in a vulnerable sort of way; there was something about her mouth.<br>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; he mumbled. &#x2018;This shouldn&#x2019;t have happened. Someone should have stopped you. Long before you came into the shop.&#x2019;<br>She continued to stare.<br>&#x2018;There was a foul-up somewhere.&#x2019;<br>She nodded.<br>&#x2018;Are you all right?&#x2019;<br>She nodded again, put her arms to her sides. As yet he hadn&#x2019;t looked around him, gained an overview of the situation. He heard the cold sound of flexi-cuffs being tightened around wrists and the curses from one of the men arrested. That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s come to, he thought. I rely on others.<br>&#x2018;May I take your name?&#x2019; he asked in an unemotional voice.<br>&#x2018;Have I done something wrong?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;No, but you were here. Now you&#x2019;re a witness.&#x2019;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumn days passed. A gloom pervaded the daylight hours and time crystallized into work: larceny &#x2013; petty and grand, murders, suicides, robberies and domestic violence; everyday life &#x2013; a series of incidents, some of which make an impression, while most are soon forgotten. Your consciousness is trained to repress. You crave a <br>holiday, two weeks on a Greek island in the summer or, slightly shorter-term, a long weekend on the ferry to Denmark. Drinking, shouting, laughing, homing in on a woman with just the right kind of husky laugh, who has warm eyes and thinks pointed shoes are absolutely great. But until that happens: days like photographic slides &#x2013; images which flicker for a few seconds before disappearing, some easier to remember than others, but then those disappear too. Not that he thought any more about her. Or perhaps he did? <br>Perhaps he occasionally remembered the sapphire blue eyes, or the feeling of her body pressed against his &#x2013; there on the floor of Badir&#x2019;s shop. Or the man who was now slowly but surely being dragged through the mill of penal indictment, soon to be convicted of the organized smuggling of meat and cigarettes, then resisting arrest, threatening behaviour, illegal possession of a weapon and so on. Soon to swell the ranks of those waiting for an available cell to serve their term. Despite such thoughts crossing his mind, there was one thing Frank Fr�lich was pretty sure about, and that was he would never see her again.<br>It happened one rainy afternoon in late October. Darkness was drawing in; a cold wind was blowing up Grensen in Oslo city <br>centre. The wind caught hold of people&#x2019;s clothing, replicating Munch&#x2019;s paintings: shadows of figures ducking away from the driving rain, huddling up, using their umbrellas as shields or &#x2013; if they didn&#x2019;t have an umbrella &#x2013; thrusting their hands into their pockets and sprinting through the rain in search of a protective ledge or awning. The wet tarmac stole the last of the daylight, and the water trickling into the tramlines reflected the neon glare. Frank Fr�lich had finished work and was feeling hungry. Accordingly, he made for Kaf� Norr�na. The room smelt of hot chocolate with cream. He immediately wanted some and queued up. In front of the cash till, he changed his mind and asked what the soup of the day was.<br>&#x2018;Italian. Minestrone.&#x2019; The serving lady was the impatient kind, sour expression and limp posture.<br>He took his tray of hot soup, a roll and a glass of water. Found a place by the window, eased himself onto the stool and stared out at the people hurrying down Grensen with upturned collars. A woman rested her chin on the lapels of her jacket to keep it closed. The <br>rain worsened. The reflections of car lights and flashing neon signs swept across house walls. People in the street resembled cowering <br>children, hiding from a booming voice somewhere above.<br>&#x2018;Hello.&#x2019;<br>Frank Fr�lich put down his spoon and turned round. There was something familiar about her face. About thirty years of age, he thought. She had black hair, partly covered by a woolly hat, held in place like a beret. Her complexion was pale, her lips were bright red and her eyebrows formed sharp angles, two inverted Vs high on her forehead.<br>Classy, he thought. It struck him that she wouldn&#x2019;t have been out of place in a black-and-white still from a forties film. She was wearing a long, clinging woollen skirt and short jacket. Her outfit emphasized her figure &#x2013; hips, waist and shoulders.<br>&#x2018;Torggata,&#x2019; she said, tilting her head, becoming a little impatient at his slow-wittedness. &#x2018;Marlboro, Prince, cigarettes.&#x2019;<br>Then he remembered: the eyes and especially her mouth. Which lent her an air of vulnerability. But the small wrinkles around her mouth told him she was older than he had at first believed. Instinctively, he searched for the blue of her eyes &#x2013; without being able to find it immediately. Must be the light, he thought, must be the harsh neon light which deadened the blue. The lightbulbs in Badir&#x2019;s shop must have been the regular variety.<br>&#x2018;You let me go.&#x2019;<br>He suddenly felt uneasy and looked for ways out. Not much was left of the soup and he had paid. Something about this encounter put him on edge; the situation activated a slumbering sensation at the back of his mind. He would have to rebuff her approach, but he was slightly reluctant. She was standing quite close to him, looking into his eyes. It would be unpleasant turning his back on her. He said: &#x2018;My pleasure. You hadn&#x2019;t done anything wrong.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t think so?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Excuse me?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I took three packets of Marlboro and a Snickers bar.&#x2019;<br>He pushed his bowl away. &#x2018;So you&#x2019;re a thief, then.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You saw, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Saw what?&#x2019; He put on his jacket and patted his pocket to check he had his wallet.<br>&#x2018;You saw me.&#x2019;<br>For a brief moment, the words unsettled him. You saw me. She could have expressed herself differently, but this was a message which he could not misunderstand. It was an attempt to present herself not just as an object for his attention, but to suggest <br>she owed him a favour because he had done something for her, something that would have to remain a secret.<br>&#x2018;I have to go,&#x2019; he announced. &#x2018;All the best . . .&#x2019; He reflected. Her name. She had told him her name. He had even made a mental note of it. In the nick of time the name emerged in his consciousness. He said: &#x2018;. . . Have a nice evening, Elisabeth.&#x2019;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood still for a few seconds as the glass door slid to behind him. The wind had dropped a little, but the rain was still pouring down. Buttoning his jacket, he shook himself, as if to rid himself of the discomfiture of the incident. He took the few metres to the underpass leading to the Metro at a brisk pace. Here, he went into his usual Metro trance to the accompaniment of the smell of refuse, used air, wet woollens, autumn and influenza; elderly women ran gloved fingers under their noses; men raised their eyes to God in a quiet prayer to be spared another bout of angina, here in this tight scrum of humanity in which everyone was blind to each other&#x2019;s existence. He squeezed back against the glass wall of the Metro carriage, touched the condensation on the glass; only to wake from the trance when the doors shut at Manglerud and the creature of habit in him liberated itself from its corner to step <br>closer to the doors as the train braked on its approach to Ryen <br>station. The doors were two metal lips which opened, ready to spit him out. At this altitude, the rain had turned into the autumn&#x2019;s first sleet showers. Car headlights shone on the tarmac of the ring road and were devoured by the blackness. He trudged up the hill as cars sped by.<br>Something must have caught his attention, a sound or a shadow behaving differently, as he approached the entrance to his flat. He stopped and turned. The street light by the petrol station was directly behind her, outlining her silhouette in yellow light. She stood still. He stood still. They were alert to each other&#x2019;s every move. Her hands deep in the pockets of the short jacket and her facial expression in shadow. Her hair cascaded down onto <br>her shoulders, with the light from the street lamp like an aura above the woolly hat, the tight jacket and the skirt covering her knees.<br>It was just the two of them &#x2013; in the dark. No one else around. <br>The remote drone of the traffic. A street lamp buzzed. He walked towards her with determined steps. She didn&#x2019;t move. He walked into the road and then around her, forcing her to follow him with her eyes and turn towards the light so that he could see her face.<br>They were staring into each other&#x2019;s eyes throughout this whole carousel movement. He detected something in her gaze: an <br>energy, something he couldn&#x2019;t define in words, something it was difficult to confront without speaking. &#x2018;Are you following me?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;d rather I didn&#x2019;t?&#x2019;<br>The response took his breath away &#x2013; again.<br>Finally she lowered her gaze. &#x2018;You saw me,&#x2019; she said.<br>Those three words again. &#x2018;And?&#x2019; he said.<br>They stood close to each other. He had gone right up to her but she hadn&#x2019;t budged. He could feel the warmth of her breath on his cheek.<br>She took his hands in hers.<br>His mind froze. He cleared his throat, but didn&#x2019;t move. She had heavy eyelids and long, curly eyelashes. At the end of each lash a tiny drop of condensation had gathered. Her breath streamed like mist from between the half-open lips, caressing his cheeks before it dissipated. As she spoke, the words nestled against his cheeks.<br>&#x2018;What did you say?&#x2019; was as much as his voice could manage. His mouth was only a few centimetres from hers as she softly whispered: &#x2018;I forget no one if I kiss you.&#x2019;<br>Then he released his hands and clasped her slender face between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, she stood for a long time in the shower. He lay on his back in bed listening to the murmur of the water.<br>When she closed the front door behind her, it was four o&#x2019;clock in the morning. Then he got up and went into the bathroom. He stood with his forehead against the tiled wall as the water stroked his shoulders. His mind was on the hours that had passed. The way his body towered over hers. The way she had held his gaze as he breathed in again and again, then let it out loudly, breathing in again and again, letting it out loudly again and again. The beads of sweat between her breasts, reflecting thousands of facets. The way her soft breasts rose and fell to the rhythm of her breathing before he thrust the breath out of her. The desire raw, untamed, hungry &#x2013; the kind that leaves in its wake guilt, shame, abortions, fatherless children, HIV. He could still feel the pressure of her fingers as <br>she grabbed him hard around the waist, ten nails digging into him. She wanted more, yet had less breath because she could see the countdown flicker behind his eyelids.<br>Afterwards, alone, his head pressed against the tiles: Frank Fr�lich twists the tap to red and allows himself to be scalded by boiling-hot water &#x2013; recalling the strange tattoo on her hip as she straddles him backwards. He cannot picture this without becoming aroused yet again, feeling the urge to do it once more, knowing that if she had walked in through the door at that moment, he would have thrown her down on the bathroom floor, or in there, over the desk &#x2013; and he would have been unstoppable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such thoughts are a virus. In the end they disappear, but it takes time. Eventually everything passes. Three days, possibly four, <br>a week &#x2013; then the thoughts release their grip. In the end your <br>body is left numb and begins to function normally, glad that it is over.<br>Six days went by. He was back in shape. But then the m...</p><h2>Working Fire: The Making of an Accidental Fireman</h2><p>A compelling and moving memoir chronicles one man&#39;s journey from Ivy League graduate to dedicated firefighter and paramedic, discussing his training, the mpments of triumph and tragedy, the harrowing and hilarious calls, his fierce passion for his work, and the camraderie that exists among his comrades.</p><p>Zac Unger is a firefighter and paramedic in Oakland, California. He has written about his life and work for the online magazine Slate. He is a graduate of Deep Springs College, Brown University, and UC Berkeley.In my first months it was all pole. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine taking the stairs like most of the old-timers. For me the pole stood for everything I admired about the fire department&#x2014;speed, daring, an ageless tradition offered to only a select few. After dark I would lie in my bunk, fully dressed and vibrating with energy, waiting wide eyed for a call to come in. During my first months at the firehouse, I refused to let myself sleep, fearful that I&#x2019;d somehow miss the cascading bells and harsh fluorescent lights that erupt when an alarm comes in. When the bells went off, I&#x2019;d go flying out of my bunk and hit the pole running, spin down to the ground floor, spring into the rig, and wait. Within thirty seconds&#x2014;it seemed like an eternity&#x2014;the others would arrive at the rig, snapping their suspenders into place, kicking sleepy kinks out of their knees. The officer would key the mike to tell dispatch that we were leaving, then flick a match to his cigarette and settle into his seat. We&#x2019;d race through darkened streets, the officer&#x2019;s tobacco smoke curling back to where I sat fumbling with my heavy coat and gloves. Usually we&#x2019;d leave the sirens turned off, and I&#x2019;d watch our progress in the blinking lights playing on the shuttered shop windows and the huddled bodies of men sleeping in doorways. There was no good reason to wake them up.<p><br>&#x201c;Confirming stills. Confirming stills.&#x201d; The voice of a female dispatcher crackles over the radio, telling us that it&#x2019;s likely to be a real fire this time, not just one of our many false alarms. If more than one person calls it in, the flames are apt to be big and showy. They call it a &#x201c;still&#x201d; because when the information comes over the firehouse loudspeaker, conversations die in midair, the clink of coffee cups goes silent, and every fireman holds his breath, hoping that the address is in his district and he&#x2019;ll get to fight a fire. That&#x2019;s the only time a fireman is ever still. A &#x201c;confirming still&#x201d; means that the fire is big enough to have attracted attention from several people, all of whom called in to 911 simultaneously.</p><p><br>With the confirmation, the officer stubs out the cigarette on the side of his boot and rolls down the window, sniffing for smoke on the quiet summer air. He flips on the siren now, and I hear it echoed by other distant fire engines triangulating their way toward us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not smelling it yet. You smell anything?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; says Jack Alvarez, the firefighter sitting beside me. &#x201c;Probably ain&#x2019;t shit.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been sleeping, bent forward in his seat, his head resting in the cup of his hands. I didn&#x2019;t see him put the plug of tobacco into his lower lip. Maybe he goes to bed with it already in place. He rouses himself and slips fluidly into his turnout coat, buckling it over his thick cotton sweatshirt, the one with the logo of a grinning clown holding a fireman&#x2019;s ax. He crosses himself, then kisses his wedding ring, and I make a mental note to develop a ritual for myself, some sort of secular facsimile of prayer that I can use before I go running into a burning building.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Aw, hell. We&#x2019;ll see it when we get there.&#x201d; The officer rolls up his window and shakes a fresh cigarette out of the package. Alvarez clips the last buckle on his air bottle and then settles his head back down into his hands and closes his eyes.<br>We turn the last corner, and we&#x2019;re right on top of it. The building on fire is a classic &#x201c;taxpayer&#x201d;-type structure, meaning it has apartments on the upper floors and shops at street level. Fire runs the length of the ground floor, shooting out of plate-glass windows shattered by the heat. Alvarez claps his gloved hands and howls like a kid on a roller coaster. Engine Fifteen is already on the scene, and they&#x2019;ve hooked a hydrant and laid a big-line supply hose clear across the middle of the intersection. What few cars are out at midnight on a Tuesday are driving right over the hose as if they can&#x2019;t see our flashing lights. It&#x2019;s not the first fire I&#x2019;ve been to in my few weeks on the job, but I can tell that it&#x2019;s going to be the best one yet.<br>Truck Four pulls up at the same time we do, slaloming into position nose to nose with our engine. The guys are off the rig before it comes to a stop, and they go to work in a blur. It&#x2019;s hard not to watch, not to be so impressed by the coordinated aggression of the scene that I forget to do my own job.</p><p><br>The truckies start working on the building&#x2019;s front door, a big roll-up made of corrugated metal. The first guy to the door reaches high above his head and buries a whirring circular saw in the metal, throwing sparks in every direction. He draws the saw down to the ground, then starts again from the top. When he finishes, another fireman gives the door a backward mule kick and a large triangular cutout falls away into the smoky darkness, opening up a new hole to enter through. Ladders slam against the side of the building, and men run up the rungs and disappear over the lip of the roof parapet.</p><p><br>The first-in crew has an attack line in place, charged with water and ready to go, and they move inside as soon as the door is cut open. They&#x2019;re going inside to find the seat of the fire, the root of the flames. Spraying water through the window won&#x2019;t do anything but keep the fire from spreading to the next building over. To actually put something out and keep a building from burning to the ground, you have to go inside.</p></p><h2>Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of the Jewish World Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion</h2><p>Hitler&#39;s anti-semitic obsession stems from his fascination with an enormously influential literary forgery, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Warrant for Genocide sets the story of the Protocols within the broader context of the history of anti-semitism-a key book for understanding the murderous folly of the twentieth century.</p><p>The myth of Jews as children of the Devil, mysterious, uncanny and possessed of sinister powers, has persisted since the second century, when they were accused of killing Christian children, torturing the consecrated wafer and poisoning wells. In his history of the demonizing of Jewry, British academic Cohn (The Pursuit of the Millennium), describes the modern adaptation of that myth as promulgated through the turn-of-the-century forgery "Protocols of the Elders of Zion." This document was purported to plan Jewish domination of the globe through control of political parties, banks, the press and public opinion, "casting a net of gold and steel around the world." Although soon to be proven a blatant hoax by the Berne trial in 1935, the "Protocols" sold 120,000 copies in Germany in one year and helped convince 17 million Germans to vote Nazi in 1933. Cohn shows how the fiction of a Jewish conspiracy then combined with volkisch-racist ideology to produce the Holocaust: civilization needed to be rescued from this dark, earthbound race by the "world of good, of light, incarnated in blond, blue-eyed people" marching under the sun-god's symbol, the swastika. This, Cohn argues, with convincing evidence, was the justification used for murdering two thirds of all the Jews in Europe. Long out of print, Cohn's book, complete with a new afterword and extended extracts from the "Protocols" in the appendix, is a well-documented, accessible introduction to a key factor in the history of the Holocaust. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Cohn here does a little literary detection as he unravels the history of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a forged volume that allegedly laid out a plan for Jewish world domination. Though a fake, the Protocols nonetheless was at the root of a great deal of anti-Semitism in Europe and elsewhere and was quite popular in the Third Reich.

Axelrod packs cowboy lore, historical nuggets and astute social commentary into the text that accompanies each song, touching on subjects as varied as chuck wagons, Annie Oakley and the exploitation of immigrant labor in the building of the transcontinental railroad. An index of titles and first lines is included, as well as guitar chord diagrams. Readers from Abilene to Dodge City--even those who can't carry a tune--will want this one for their Americana collections. All ages. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 3 Up-- A handsome collection of songs and paintings about cowboys, pioneers, bad men, and heroes. Double-page spreads include songs from the lively ``Old Dan Tucker'' to the cattle lullaby, ``The Night-Herding Song'' and reproductions of paintings by artists such as Frederic Remington, Winslow Homer, George Catlin, W. H. D. Koerner, and a host of others. Accompanying the songs, which are geared to beginning and intermediate musicians, is a commentary relating the music and/or paintings to life in the Old West as well as smaller reproductions of sculptures and artifacts from chewing-gum cards to cowboy boots. A book that is a pleasure both as a practical songbook and as an exciting visual bit of Americana. --Ann Stell, The Smithtown Library, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Babushka</h2><p>Babushka lives on her own in a cottage where everything is as neat as a pin. But she is so busy cleaning and polishing that she hardly notices the miraculous events going on around her. Then a mysterious dream leads her to put her daily worries aside and venture out to find a special baby. On her journey, she learns that the more you give away in love, the more you will receive. Readers of all ages and beliefs will be charmed and captivated by this poignant Russian folk tale. Children young and old will adore Sophie Fatus&#39;s beautiful folk-art illustrations of flowy ethereal angels, friendly wide-eyed characters wearing warm colorful shawls and quirky animals along Babushka&#39;s path.</p><p>Sandra Ann Horn was a clinical psychologist until 1992, when she moved to Southampton University to set up and run the Master of Science programme in Health Psychology. She also spends her time writing for children and has had a number of books published with various companies. Babushka is her first book with Barefoot Books. Sophie Fatus is a full-time illustrator and sculptress, who studied at the prestigious Academy of Fine Art in Paris. Her brightly coloured illustrations and quirky style are world-renowned and have graced the pages of several other Barefoot Books including The Story Tree (2001), The Barefoot Book of Monsters! (2003), Riddle me This! (2003), My Daddy is Pretzel (2004) and Farmyard Jamboree (2005). Sophie lives in Florence.K-Gr. 3. Babushka is too busy to accompany the three kings on their way to see the Christ child. Later an angel appears in her dream, singing about "a baby born in a stable, with nothing but a swaddling cloth to wrap him in." Troubled by the image, Babushka sets out to find the child, bringing a warm shawl and other presents. Along the way, she meets several people in need and generously gives away her gifts. Imagine her surprise when she reaches the stable and sees the baby wrapped in her shawl with the other presents nearby. Mary's simple explanation is the key to the story: "Everything you gave with love, you gave to my son, also." This is a departure from the traditional Russian folktale, in which Babushka becomes a Santa Claus-like figure, never finding the baby she seeks but leaving presents for other children. Fatus' acrylic illustrations burst with interesting details, patterns, and textures. Their figures resemble miniature dolls with such exaggerated features as heavily lashed almond eyes set in perfectly round heads. A lovely Christmas story with a wonderful message about the joys of selfless giving. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is the Second Coming and the Apocalypse at the same time: Good AI versus evil AI."</i> --John Brockman<br><br>More than sixty years ago, mathematician-philosopher Norbert Wiener published a book on the place of machines in society that ended with a warning: "we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions.... The hour is very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door." <br><br>In the wake of advances in unsupervised, self-improving machine learning, a small but influential community of thinkers is considering Wiener's words again. In <i>Possible Minds</i>, John Brockman gathers their disparate visions of where AI might be taking us.<br><br>The fruit of the long history of Brockman's profound engagement with the most important scientific minds who have been thinking about AI--from Alison Gopnik and David Deutsch to Frank Wilczek and Stephen Wolfram<i>--Possible Minds</i> is an ideal introduction to the landscape of crucial issues AI presents. The collision between opposing perspectives is salutary and exhilarating; some of these figures, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and physicist Max Tegmark, are deeply concerned with the threat of AI, including the existential one, while others, notably robotics entrepreneur Rodney Brooks, philosopher Daniel Dennett, and bestselling author Steven Pinker, have a very different view.

A couple of thousand feet above the tiny canvas tent the summit of the world&#x2019;s highest mountain stood impassively, waiting for someone to have the courage to approach.</p> <p>Inside the ice-crusted shelter, two forms lay still as death. Then there was a groan, a stirring, and eventually the slow scratch of match against sandpaper. Low voices shared the high-altitude agonies of waking, the heating of water, the struggle with frozen boots.</p> <p>As the sun rose through wisps of cloud beyond the Tibetan hills to the east, one of the men emerged through the tent flaps. It was a fine morning for the attempt, with only a few clouds in the sky. The two of them stood for a while, shuffling their feet and blowing into their hands. Inside the tent lay a mess of sleeping bags and food. The men lifted oxygen sets onto their backs, then they turned towards the mountain and stamped off into history.</p> <p>On the 6th June, 1924, George Mallory and Sandy Irvine disappeared into the mists of history. George Mallory&#x2019;s body was discovered high on Everest in 1999. Sandy Irvine&#x2019;s body is still believed to be on the mountain having been rediscovered in 1975 by a Chinese climber who was killed the very next day.</p> <p>In 1993, Graham Hoyland became the 15th English man to climb Everest having become obsessed by the mountain and the myth of what happened to Mallory and Irvine. It was his evidence that led to the discovery of Mallory&#x2019;s body and it will be his evidence that will lead to the discovery of Sandy Irvine&#x2019;s.</p> <p>The Last Hours on Everest is the most detailed reconstruction of what happened after the two English climbing legends left the camp on that fateful day. Combining personal experience, the physical evidence found on the mountain and an insight into the hearts and minds of the two climbers, Graham Hoyland produces the most compelling description of what actually happened on that day and the answer to that most intriguing of questions &#x2013; did they actually climb Everest?</p></p><p><p>Climber, author and film director Graham Hoyland was the 15th Briton to climb Everest and during one of his nine expeditions to the mountain was responsible for the discovery of George Mallory&#x2019;s body. He writes for the Independent newspaper and worked as a BBC director on programmes such as Dragons&#x2019; Den, the Today programme and Around the World in 80 Faiths.</p>The tantalizing enigma in Everest annals is whether the first to reach the summitwere George Mallory and Sandy Irvine in 1924. Not solved by the discoveries of Irvine&#x2019;s ax in 1933 and Mallory&#x2019;s body in 1999, it could be settled if a camera the latter carried is ever discovered, a camera given Mallory by a relative of Hoyland&#x2019;s. That, plus a native interest in mountaineering, inspired Hoyland&#x2019;s interest in Everest and Mallory. As Hoyland chronicles his expeditions to the mountain, which he has topped, he ruminates about Mallory&#x2019;s personality and motivations, referring to Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest, by Wade Davis (2011). Hoyland&#x2019;s contribution to the Mallory mystery derives from his firsthand experience, obtained in the course of producing films about Everest, of the mountain face that Mallory crossed, plus a reconstruction of his clothing to test whether Mallory could have survived in it to the summit. Offering a plausible theory of events, Hoyland concludes that . . . well, tempt the adventure audience to find out by displaying this engaging title on the new-books shelf. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>A Voice in the Wind (Mark of the Lion)</h2><p>This classic series has already inspired nearly 2 million readers, but both loyal fans and new readers will want this 20th anniversary edition of a Christian classic, which includes a foreword from the publisher, a letter from and Q &amp; A with Francine Rivers, color map, an illustrated glossary, and discussion questions suitable for personal and group use.

His topics range from quarries and the foundations of cathedrals to graveyards and earthworms, from husbandry in ancient Rome to composting in Florida. Logan pays tribute to the dung beetle as a symbol of renewal; he notes that dirt is the source of many drugs that work against infectious diseases (penicillin, streptomycin). He discusses the many forms of clay and the agricultural practices of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and the Iroquois.

Although this new version (Harper, 1962; o.p.) has a completely new look and the text has been revised somewhat, the quiet, contemplative mood is unchanged. A young boy is reluctant for his day to end, but his mother assures him that nothing in the natural world ends. "It begins in another place, or in a different way." She responds with rich verbal images to his questions about where the wind, waves, and clouds go, and about the changes of the seasons. Revisions in the text include more questions about the environment and the elimination of questions about man-made things, such as trains and roads. Vitale's illustrations provide a visual response to the simple questions asked, while adding interesting detail about various forms of underwater life, the elements of storms, and landscapes in other parts of the world. Using paint on wood, the artist includes several different styles of modern art. There are hints of Van Gogh, Chagall, and others. Some scenes are done in the folk-art style the illustrator used so successfully in Jim Aylesworth's The Folks in the Valley (HarperCollins, 1992).

Kingsolver&#x2019;s selections for The Best American Short Stories 2001 showcase a wide variety of new voices and masters, such as Alice Munro, Rick Moody, Dorothy West, and John Updike. &#x201c;Reading these stories was both a distraction from and an anchor to the complexities of my life &#x2014; my pleasure, my companionship, my salvation. I hope they will be yours.&#x201d; &#x2014; Barbara Kingsolver</p><p>Katrina Kenison has been the series editor of The Best American Short Stories since 1990. She currently resides in Massachusetts.Foreword<br><br>IN THE 1942 VOLUME of The Best American Short Stories, the <br>anthology"s new annual editor, Martha Foley, attempted to define the <br>form. "A good short story," she wrote, "is a story which is not too <br>long and which gives the reader the feeling he has undergone a <br>memorable experience."<br> Over the past eleven years, during my own tenure as annual <br>editor of this eighty-six-year-old series, I"ve run across numerous <br>other writers" attempts to come up with some sort of standard by <br>which to measure the short story. Few have managed to add much to Ms. <br>Foley"s democratic and rather obvious criteria.<br> At symposiums and writers" conferences, I"ve learned to duck <br>and weave around the inevitable question "What do you look for in a <br>short story?" I wish I knew! Heart? Soul? Truth? Voice? Integrity of <br>intention and skill in execution? The answer is all of the above, and <br>none of the above. For I don"t really "look" for anything; when a <br>story works, I know it in my gut, not in my head, and only then &#x2014; <br>after laughing, after brushing away a tear, after taking a moment to <br>catch my breath and return to the here and now &#x2014; do I set about <br>analyzing the successes and failures of a writer"s effort. It would <br>certainly be nice to have a checklist, a foolproof grading system, a <br>tally sheet of pluses and minuses. But reading is a subjective <br>activity, even for those of us who are fortunate enough to read for a <br>living. We editors may read more pages than the average American, and <br>we may read faster, but when it comes right down to it, I believe we <br>all read for the same reason: in order to test our own knowledge of <br>life and to enlarge on it.<br> Out of the three thousand or so short stories I read in any <br>given year, I may file two hundred away. And I always marvel at how <br>precious this stash of chosen fiction seems to me; these are the <br>stories that, for one reason or another, exerted some kind of hold on <br>the priorities of my heart. Even now, I have boxes of old stories, <br>going back a decade and more, stacked up in the basement; I"ve saved <br>every file card I"ve filled out since 1990 as well &#x2014; a treasure trove <br>of stories, a king"s ransom of human wisdom caught and held on those <br>hundreds of moldering pages. When it comes to cleaning closets, I"m <br>ruthless. But those stories . . . well, how could I throw them away? <br>Who knows when a particular bit of fiction will prove useful? <br>Someday, I think, someone will need that story about the emotional <br>roller coaster of new motherhood; or this one, which reminds us what <br>sixteen years old really feels like; or that one, which could help a <br>friend prepare for death . . .<br> Toward year"s end, I sift through the current piles and begin <br>to ship batches of tales off to the guest editor, always wondering <br>whether he or she will share my tastes and predilections and curious <br>to know whether the narrative voice that whispered so urgently in my <br>ear will speak with as much power to another. Truth be told, it is an <br>anxious time. Just as, when I was a teenager, I wanted my parents to <br>agree that my boyfriend was indeed Prince Charming, I can"t help but <br>hope that the guest editor will share my passion for the year"s <br>collection of short story suitors.<br> I have no clue about Barbara Kingsolver"s taste in men, but I <br>discovered right away that she and I could fall in love with the same <br>short stories. And when her introduction to this volume came spooling <br>through my fax machine, I stood there reading it page by page, <br>nodding in agreement with her discoveries and full of gratitude for <br>the pickiness (her word) and devotion she brought to this task of <br>reading, judging, and finally choosing. And then, as the next-to-last <br>page emerged into my waiting hands, I saw it: a new definition for <br>the short story, at last. To Martha Foley"s sixty-year-old criteria <br>we can now add Barbara Kingsolver"s useful dictum: "A good short <br>story cannot simply be Lit Lite, but the successful execution of <br>large truths delivered in tight spaces." Writers take heed!<br> In choosing this year"s collection of The Best American Short <br>Stories, Kingsolver has done writers and readers a great service, for <br>her own love for the form and her exacting standards have resulted in <br>a volume that is as varied in subject matter, style, voice, and <br>intent as even the most eclectic reader could wish for. Collectively, <br>these stories hum with the energy of twenty disparate voices raised <br>under one roof. They are a testament to our contemporary writers" <br>vigorous engagement with the world and to the robust good health of <br>American short fiction.<br> Some years ago, John Updike revealed, "Writing fiction, as <br>those of us who do it know, is, beneath the anxious travail of it, a <br>bliss, a healing, an elicitation of order from disorder, a praise of <br>what is, a salvaging of otherwise overlookable truths from the <br>ruthless sweep of generalization, a beating of daily dross into <br>something shimmering and absolute." Mr. Updike, who made his first <br>appearance in The Best American Short Stories in 1959, returns this <br>year for the twelfth time as a contributor. (He also served as guest <br>editor in 1984 and coedited The Best American Short Stories of the <br>Century, published in 1999.) He is the only writer in the history of <br>the series to appear in these pages for six consecutive decades &#x2014; an <br>achievement that we feel is worth noting. May he continue to beat the <br>daily dross into such shimmering and absolute works as "Personal <br>Archeology," which begins on page 326.<br><br>The stories chosen for this anthology were originally published <br>between January 2000 and January 2001. The qualifications for <br>selection are (1) original publication in nationally distributed <br>American or Canadian periodicals; (2) publication in English by <br>writers who are American or Canadian, or who have made the United <br>States or Canada their home; (3) original publication as short <br>stories (excerpts of novels are not knowingly considered). A list of <br>magazines consulted for this volume appears at the back of the book. <br>Editors who wish their short fiction to be considered for next year"s <br>edition should send their publications to Katrina Kenison, c/o The <br>Best American Short Stories, Houghton Mifflin Company, 222 Berkeley <br>Street, Boston, MA 02116.<br>K.K.<br>Introduction<br><br>I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED why short stories aren"t more popular in this <br>country. We Americans are such busy people you"d think we"d jump at <br>the chance to have our literary wisdom served in doses that fit <br>handily between taking the trash to the curb and waiting for the <br>carpool. We should favor the short story and adore the poem. But we <br>don"t. Short story collections rarely sell half as well as novels; <br>they are never blockbusters. They are hardly ever even block-denters. <br>From what I gather, most Americans would sooner read a five-hundred-<br>page book about southern France or a boy attending wizard school or <br>how to make home decor from roadside trash or anything than pick up a <br>book offering them a dozen tales of the world complete in twenty <br>pages apiece. And I won"t even discuss what they will do to avoid <br>reading poetry.<br> Why on earth should this be? I enjoy the form so much myself <br>that when I was invited to be the guest editor for this collection, <br>forewarned that it would involve reading thousands of pages of short <br>fiction in a tight three-month period, I decided to do it. This trial <br>by fire, I thought, would disclose to me the heart of the form and <br>all its mysteries. Also, it would nicely fill the space that lay <br>ahead of me at the end of the year 2000, just after my planned <br>completion of a novel and before its publication the following <br>spring. The creative dead space between galley proofs and a book"s <br>first review is a dreaded time in an author"s life, comparable to the <br>tenth month of a pregnancy. (I"ve had two post-term babies, so I know <br>what I"m talking about.) I look at the prepublication epoch as a <br>Great Sargasso Sea and always try to fill it with satisfying short-<br>term projects. I reexamined the previous editions of this series on <br>my shelf and considered the assignment. Amy Tan, who edited The Best <br>American Short Stories 1999, described the organized pleasure of <br>reading one story a day for three months. That sounded like a tidy <br>plan to put on my calendar. Editing a story collection, plus a short <br>family vacation to Mexico and a week-long stint lecturing on a ship <br>in the Caribbean, would fill those months perfectly, providing just <br>enough distraction from my prepublication doldrums.<br> If you ever want to know what it sounds like when the <br>universe goes "Ha! Ha!" just put a tidy plan on your calendar.<br> My months of anticipated quiet at the end of 2000 turned out <br>to be the most eventful of my life, in which I was called upon to <br>attend to an astonishing number of unexpected duties, celebrations, <br>and crises. I weathered a tour and publicity storm with the release <br>of my new novel, eight months ahead of schedule. While handling this <br>plus the lectures at sea, I learned of a family member"s catastrophic <br>illness, I was invited to have dinner with President and Mrs. <br>Clinton, and I took my eighth-grader to the funeral of her beloved <br>friend &#x2014; not to mention the normal background noise of family <br>urgencies. These two months of our lives were stitched together by <br>trains, automobiles, the M.S. Ryndam, and thirty-two separate <br>airplane flights. (A perverse impulse caused me to save my boarding <br>passes and count them.) Naturally this would be the year when I also <br>experienced a true airplane emergency, and I don"t mean the garden-<br>variety altitude plunge. I mean that I finally got to see what those <br>yellow masks look like.<br> Through it all, as best I could, I read stories. On a cold <br>Iowa afternoon with the white light of snowfall flooding the windows, <br>sitting quietly with a loved one enduring his new regime of <br>chemotherapy, I read about a nineteenth-century explorer losing his <br>grasp on life in the Himalayas. On another day, when I found myself <br>wide-eyed long after midnight on a ship so racked by storms that the <br>books were diving off the shelves of my cabin, I amused myself with a <br>droll fable about two feuding widows in the Pyrenees. I read my way <br>through a long afternoon sitting on the dirty carpet of Gate B-22 at <br>O"Hare, successfully tuning out all the mayhem and canceled-flight <br>refugees around me, except for one young woman who kept shouting into <br>her cell phone, "I"m almost out of minutes!" (This was not the same <br>day my airplane would lose its oxygen; the screenwriter of my life <br>isn"t that corny.) I read through a Saturday while my four-year-old <br>dozed in my lap with a mysterious fever that plastered her curls to <br>her forehead and burned my skin through her pajamas; I read in the <br>early mornings in Mexico while parrots chattered outside our window. <br>Some days I was able to read no stories at all &#x2014; when my youngest was <br>not asleep on my lap, for instance &#x2014; and on other days I read many. <br>Eighteen stories got lost in my luggage and took a trip of their very <br>own, but returned to me in time.<br> My ideas about what I would gain from this experience <br>collapsed as I began to wrestle instead with what I would be able to <br>give to it. How could I read 125 stories amid all this craziness and <br>compare them fairly? In the beginning I marked each one with a <br>ranking of minus, plus, or double-plus. That lasted for exactly three <br>stories. It soon became clear that what looks like double-plus on an <br>ordinary day can be a whole different thing when the oxygen masks are <br>dangling from the overhead compartment. I despaired of my wildly <br>uncontrolled circumstances, thinking constantly, If this were my <br>story, would I want some editor reading it under these conditions?<br> Maybe not. But the problem is, life is like that. Editors, <br>readers, all of us, have to work reading into our busy lives. The <br>best of it can stand up to the challenge &#x2014; and if anything can do it, <br>it should be the genre of short fiction, with its economy of language <br>and revving plot-driven engine. We catch our reading on the fly, and <br>that is probably the whole point anyway. If we lived in silent white <br>rooms with no emergencies beyond the wilting of the single red rose <br>in the vase, we probably wouldn"t need fiction to help us explain the <br>inexplicable things, the storms at sea and deaths of too-young <br>friends. If we lived in a room like that, we would probably just <br>smile and take naps.<br> What makes writing good? That"s easy: the lyrical <br>description, the arresting metaphor, the dialogue that falls so true <br>on the ear it breaks the heart, the plot that winds up exactly where <br>it should. But these stories I was to choose among had been culled <br>from thousands of others, so all were beautifully written. I couldn"t <br>favor (or disfavor) the ones by my favorite writers, because their <br>authorship was concealed from me. I knew only that they had been <br>published in magazines in the last year and preselected by the series <br>editor, Katrina Kenison, who had done for me the heroic service of <br>separating distinguished stories from the run-of-the-mill. My task <br>was to choose, among the good, the truly great. How was I supposed to <br>do it?<br> With a pile of stories on my lap, I sat with this question <br>early on and tried to divine why it is that I love a short story when <br>I do, and the answer came to me quite clearly: I love it for what it <br>tells me about life. If it tells me something I didn"t already know, <br>or that I maybe suspected but never framed quite that way, or that <br>never before socked me divinely in the solar plexus, then the story <br>is worth the read.<br> From that moment my task became simple. I relaxed and read <br>for the pleasure of it, and when I finished each story, I wrote a <br>single sentence on the first page underneath the title, in the space <br>conveniently opened up for me where the author"s name had been masked <br>out. Just one sentence of pure truth, if I"d found it, which <br>generally I did. No bumpy air or fevers or chattering parrots could <br>change this one true thing the story had meant to tell me. This is <br>how I began to see the heart of the form. While nearly all the <br>stories were expertly written, and most were pleasant to read, they <br>varied enormously in the weight and value of what they carried &#x2014; in <br>whether it was sand or gemstones I held in my palm when the words had <br>trickled away. Some beautifully written stories gave me truths so <br>self-evident that when I wrote them down, I was embarrassed. "Young <br>love is mostly selfish," some told me, and others were practically <br>lining up to declare, "Alcoholism ruins lives and devastates <br>children!" In the privacy of my reading, I probably made that special <br>face teenagers make when forced to attend to the obvious. Of all the <br>days of my life, these were the ones in which I was perhaps most <br>acutely aware that time is precious. So please, tell me something I <br>don"t already know. Sometimes I couldn"t find anything at all to <br>write in that little space under the story"s title, but most were <br>clear enough in their intent, and many were interesting enough to <br>give me pause. And then came one that rang like a bell. "An orphaned <br>child needs to find her own peculiar way to her mo...</p><h2>Consciousness and Mental Life</h2><p>In recent decades, issues that reside at the center of philosophical and psychological inquiry have been absorbed into a scientific framework variously identified as "brain science," "cognitive science," and "cognitive neuroscience." Scholars have heralded this development as revolutionary, but a revolution implies an existing method has been overturned in favor of something new. What long-held theories have been abandoned or significantly modified in light of cognitive neuroscience? <br><br><i>Consciousness and Mental Life</i> questions our present approach to the study of consciousness and the way modern discoveries either mirror or contradict understandings reached in the centuries leading up to our own. Daniel N. Robinson does not wage an attack on the emerging discipline of cognitive science. Rather, he provides the necessary historical context to properly evaluate the relationship between issues of consciousness and neuroscience and their evolution over time. <br><br>Robinson begins with Aristotle and the ancient Greeks and continues through to Ren� Descartes, David Hume, William James, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam, and Derek Parfit. Approaching the issue from both a philosophical and a psychological perspective, Robinson identifies what makes the study of consciousness so problematic and asks whether cognitive neuroscience can truly reveal the origins of mental events, emotions, and preference, or if these occurrences are better understood by studying the whole person, not just the brain. Well-reasoned and thoroughly argued, <i>Consciousness and Mental Life</i> corrects many claims made about the success of brain science and provides a valuable historical context for the study of human consciousness.</p><p><p>How far have we really come in understanding the nature of human consciousness?</p>Daniel N. Robinson is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University and a member of the philosophy faculty at Oxford University. Producing almost fifty volumes of work, he has received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the History of Psychology division of the American Psychological Association, the Distinguished Contribution Award from the Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology Division of the same organization and the 2011 Gittler Award from the American Psychological Association. He was principal consultant to PBS and the BBC for the award-winning series <i>The Brain and The Mind</i>, and his 110 lectures for The Teaching Company are among its most successful.</p><h2>Morality and architecture: The development of a theme in architectural history and theory from the Gothic revival to the modern movement</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

At times, however, repetitive chores can feel more stressful than soothing. The authors of <i>The Sanctuary Garden</i> remind us that being in the garden (as opposed to active gardening) is a way to honor the intrinsic relatedness of people and plants. To help us get beyond our busyness, they identify seven key design elements that can turn a garden into a living retreat or sanctuary. A special entrance marks our departure from the mundane world. Water, the symbol of life, brings flow and reflection to the garden. The thoughtful use of color and the play of light can be contrived to deliberately evoke emotions--peace, comfort, awe, and respect. Natural features like sculptural rocks, wind song, and fragrance can become focal points for our attention. Artwork that supports the desired feelings can be integrated into our plantings. Finally, we can create attractive habitat for birds, pollinators, and animals. Sharing the garden with nature--not just plants--broadens our sense of connectedness to the natural world in a wholesome, healing way. The book creates a challenge: where is your sanctuary? Answering that may expand both your garden and your spirit. <i>--Ann Lovejoy</i>Christopher Forrest McDowell and Tricia Clark-McDowell founded the world-renowned Cortesia Sanctuary and Center for Natural Gardening and Healing, a 22-acre sanctuary near Eugene, Oregon, where they teach, write, and make their home.</p><h2>Fonda San Miguel: Thirty Years Of Food And Art</h2><p>In celebration of three decades of success.

As they overcame the challenges of importing ingredients from Mexico in 55-gallon drums, and attracting customers who expected a No. 1 Enchilada Dinner on the menu, a loyal clientele of adventuresome eaters began to develop. Food critics discovered the restaurant and printed rave reviews of the fresh-lime margaritas and Chef Miguel's subtle and complex dishes.

In this redesigned, updated edition, Murray discusses the development and history of Monet's Giverny estate and brings new insight to Monet s approach to gardening and design. Emphasizing his keen understanding of color balance and his genius for maximizing the effects of light, Murray explores the favorite color combinations and techniques with which Monet experimented in both painting and gardening--each pursuit informing the other. Murray's lush photographs chronicle the present-day gardens, and a section titled 'Bringing Giverny Home' provides detailed Giverny-based garden plans that can be applied anywhere. Full-color illustrations of the gardens, a list of the plants originally used by Monet, and a plant cultivation section round out this immensely helpful guide to creating year-round beauty in one's own backyard.</p>Author, photographer, painter, and garden designer Elizabeth Murray assisted in the restoration of Claude Monet's gardens in Giverny, France, and has been photographing them annually for more than twenty-five years.

As LaRouche himself notes: "Since the beginning of the 1984 Presidential campaign, I have been at the center of some among the leading crisis-developments affecting current history, including the Soviet and liberal establishment efforts to destroy the Strategic Defense Initiative." This book was written, in fact, when LaRouche was known most prominently around the world, as the author of what President Ronald Reagan called, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). It was LaRouche's role in convincing the Reagan administration to adopt his plan, that was largely responsible for earning him the hatred of the Anglo-American establishment, including the incoming Bush administration, that led to his unjust indictment and imprisonment which followed. <p>The chapter titles: The Making of an Economist; The Case of Norbert Wiener; The Long-Range Economic Forecast of 1959-1960; Who Is Shooting at Us, and Why?; The Secret of the Twentieth Century; I Keep an Old Promise; The SDI is born; My Marriage to Helga; The Founding of a Colony on Mars.</p></p><p>Lyndon LaRouche, a man who is today, without question, the world&#39;s leading economist, was already at the center of current history when this book was published 13 years ago. Some of the commentaries released by his collaborators around the world: &#34;The book &#39;Operation Juarez&#39; by Lyndon H. LaRouche, is the most important contribution to the understanding of the problem of development sector debt and for reaching a rational solution.&#34;From the Author's Forward:<br> During the course of the past nearly 20 years, I have become perhaps the most controversial among the influential figures of this decade. <p>Unlike all of the other leading candidates for the U.S. presidency since 1945, I am an influential original thinker.... For the past 40 years, the successful candidates for the presidency have been persons who, in the customary manner of speaking, advanced their own political career up to that point, by doing "the right thing at the right time," saying and doing nothing which will make enemies among important factions of the "establishment." </p><p>...My purpose is to present my development as I would recommend a biography of Mozart be written, or the biography of any other notable historical figure. My purpose is to show the mainspring of my behavior, to present what might otherwise be regarded as my innermost secret.</p></p><h2>Calico Joe</h2><p>Thirty years have passed since eleven-year-old Paul Tracy watched his troubled father, Warren, a pitcher for the New York Mets, clash with his childhood hero, the Cubs&#39; golden-boy Joe Castle, in a contest from which no winners emerged. Now the news that his father is dying brings the memory of that day flooding back. Deciding that it&#39;s time to face up to what really happened on that baseball field in 1973, father and son make their way to Calico Rock, Arkansas, where either redemption or rejection awaits them.</p><p><br> John Grisham <b>Amazon Q &amp; A with John Grisham</b> <br><br> <b>Q: </b>What's your favorite baseball team?<br> <b>A: </b>St. Louis Cardinals. My father was a Cardinals fan, as was my grandfather. When I was a kid growing up in the rural south, everyone listened to the Cardinals on the radio. We seldom missed a game. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>What's your most memorable game--as player, coach, or fan?<br> <b>A: </b>I played a lot of baseball when I was a kid and teenager, but I do not recall making any spectacular plays. When I coached baseball, my teams usually lost. As a fan, Game 6 of the World Series last year, Cardinals vs. Rangers, comes to mind. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Have you played or coached baseball? What position?<br> <b>A: </b>I was an average high school baseball player with big dreams. I tried to play in college, but got myself cut in the fall practices. I was an outfielder with a weak arm. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Why are there seemingly more baseball books--both fiction and nonfiction--than other sports?<br> <b>A: </b>Baseball is a uniquely American sport, and it is the oldest organized sport in the country. It has a rich and colorful history, and up until the last generation, it was the most popular sport for kids to play. Sadly, that is changing. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Who was the Joe Castle of your childhood--a player you revered? And was there a Warren Tracey?<br> <b>A: </b>I was never much of a Red Sox fan, but I adored Tony Conigliaro. He was a great player, and a certain Hall of Famer. The beanball that struck him in the eye ruined a great career. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>While researching <i>Calico Joe</i>, did you attend or watch games? Did you write any of the book at a stadium?<br> <b>A: </b>I only write in one place, and that's my office at home. I take a lot of notes when I travel around and research, which I did for <i>Calico Joe</i>. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Did you employ any other behind-the-scenes techniques--watch old footage, interview players, read old issues of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>?<br> <b>A: </b>Yes, all of the above. I interviewed several former major league players. I read lots of old magazines, news articles, and books about baseball, and specifically, <i>The Code</i>. I found some footage of famous beanball wars of recent times. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Do the beanball or the brushback have a place in today's baseball? Even Joe seemed to accept them as "part of the game."<br> <b>A: </b>Yes. There are times in baseball when a particular hitter must get hit. There are many reasons for this, but retaliation is always a factor. Problems arise though when the pitch is above the shoulders, and aimed at batter's head. If a pitcher does this intentionally, and they do it all the time, they are fooling around with a player's career. Throwing at a batter's head is never acceptable in baseball, even as retaliation. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Have you ever been hit? Have you ever hit someone else?<br> <b>A: </b>Every baseball player gets hit. Fortunately, I was never beaned in the head. Our coaches never let me anywhere near the pitcher's mound, so I never hit a batter. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Do you love baseball? If so, why? Any concerns that the sport and its stars (as Warren gripes in the book) have changed?<br> <b>A: </b>I still love baseball but it's not the game of my youth. The pro game today is dominated by money and, frankly, there is a lot of bad baseball being played. I find it frustrating, but I always get pumped at World Series time. College baseball is far more exciting.John Grisham is the author of twenty-four novels, one work of non-fiction, and one collection of short stories.

The streets of Edo are erupting in violence as two factions struggle for control over the ruling Tokugawa regime. One is led by the shogun's cousin, Lord Matsudaira, and the other by the shogun's second-in-command, Chamberlain Yanagisawa. Each side pressures Sano Ichiro, the shogun's most honorable investigator, to join its ranks.</p><p>When one of the shogun's most trusted advisers is found dead, Sano is forced to honor a posthumous request for a murder investigation. Senior Elder Makino believed that his death would be the result of assassination rather than natural causes. Although he and Sano were bitter enemies, Makino knew that the incorruptible Sano would be duty-bound to oblige his final wish.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes and thinly veiled threats of both Lord Matsudaira and Chamberlain Yanagisawa, Sano moves with caution. Each is eager to implicate the other in Makino's death. Sano must discover whether the death was indeed murder, and if so, whether it was motivated by politics, love, or sex. The discovery of secret alliances, both romantic and military, further complicates matters. Sano's investigation has barely begun when violent death claims another of the shogun's favorites. </p><p>With his wife, Reiko, working undercover, Sano and his chief retainer, Hirata, must not only investigate multiple deaths, but stem the tide of an impending civil war, in Laura Joh Rowland's <i>The Perfumed Sleeve</i>.</p></p><p><p><b>AN UNUSUAL DEATH, A PUZZLING CLUE, AND </b><br><b>AN UNCOMPROMISING INVESTIGATOR...</b></p><p>Sano Ichiro, Most Honorable Investigator of Events, Situations, and People is faced with his most challenging case when he investigates the death of Senior Elder Makino, the shogun's most trusted adviser.

Under the watchful eyes of the shogun's cousin, Lord Matsudaira, and the shogun's second-in-command, Chamberlain Yanagisaw, Sano moves with caution. For each is eager to implicate the other in Makino's death. But Sano must determine whether the death was indeed murder, and if so, whether it was motivated by politics, love, or sex.</p><p>When a second violent death occurs, Sano is faced with several suspects, each with a compelling motive. Was it Agemaki, Makino's stone-faced second wife; Okitsu, his beautiful young concubine; Koheiji, his handsome male houseguest; or Tamura, his faithful retainer? Or was it a political assassination? With the help of his wife, Reiko, Sano must solve the murder as he discovers just how intertwined desire and danger really are... </p><p><b>"Deftly combines a classic whodunit with vivid period detail."</b><br><b>-<i>Publishers Weekly </i></b></p><p><b>"Its constant action and exotic environment will appeal to readers and add to Rowland's already large fan base."</b><br><b>-<i>The Times-Picayune </i></b></p><p><b>LAURA JOH ROWLAND</b>, the granddaughter of Chinese and Korean immigrants, was educated at the University of Michigan and now lives in New Orleans with her husband. <i>The Perfumed Sleeve</i> is the ninth in her widely acclaimed series featuring Sano Ichiro.</p></p><h2>The Penguin science fiction omnibus</h2><p>1st Penguin 1973 edition 1st printing paperback, vg In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>Into the Storm (Destroyermen)</h2><p>Pursued by Japanese battleships, the USS Walker, a Great-War vintage destroyer under the command of Lieutenant Commander Matthew Patrick Reddy, tries to lose the enemy by heading into a mysterious storm, only to become trapped in a primitive alternate world, populated by strange creatures, in which their ship could alter the balance of power.</p><p><b>Taylor Anderson</b> is a gun-maker and forensic ballistic archeologist who has been a technical and dialogue consultant for movies and documentaries.

WALKER sails into a raging typhoon in an attempt to elude the enemy. After a disturbing ride through a weightless sea, the ship emerges into a calm that belies reality.

While essentially a science fiction tale, the text also contains numerous bons mots, both subtle and overt, and Dufris&#39;s comic timing delivers them perfectly.

But the German armies failed to score the knock-out blow they had planned. The war would drag on for four years of unprecedented slaughter.</p><p>There are many accounts of 1914 from the British point of view. The achievements of the British Expeditionary Force were the stuff of legend, but in reality there were only four divisions in the field; the French and Germans had more than 60 each. The real story of the battle can only be told by an author with the skill to mine the extensive German and French archives. Ian Senior does this with consummate skill, weaving together strategic analysis with diary entries and interview transcripts from the soldiers on the ground to create a remarkable new history. In addition, all previous classic histories on the subject either focus virtually exclusively on the British experiences or are now very out-of-date such as Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August (1962) or Sewell Tyng's Campaign of the Marne (1935).</p><p>Supported by up numerous sketch maps, extensive archival research and poignant first-hand accounts, Home before the leaves fall is an accessible, narrative account of the German invasion that came within an ace of victory, that long hot summer.</p></p><p>Ian Senior read Natural Sciences at Cambridge and has taught at Dulwich College for many years. He is also Associate Lecturer in the History of Art for the Open University and a Principal Examiner for the University of Cambridge International Examination Board.

Then, about seven years ago, I realized that I never was going to grow up -- that growing is an ever ongoing process. So I asked myself, "Well, Scotty, what is it that you've become thus far?" And as soon as I asked that question, I realized, to my absolute horror, that what I have become is an evangelist. An evangelist is the last thing on earth I ever thought I would become. And it's probably the last thing on earth you ever wanted to encounter.<br><br>The word "evangelist" carries the worst possible associations and probably brings to your mind the image of a manicured and coiffed preacher in a two-thousand-dollar suit, his gold-ringed fingers gripping a leatherette-covered Bible as he shouts at the top of his lungs: "Save me, Jee-sus!"<br><br>Fear not. I don't mean to suggest that I have become that kind of evangelist. I am using the word "evangelist" in its original sense -- the bringer of good news. But I must warn you, I am also the bringer of bad news. I am an evangelist who brings good news and bad news.<br><br>If you are anything like me, you are into delaying gratification, so when you are asked, "Which do you want first, the good news or the bad news?" you answer, "Well, the bad news first, please." So let me get the bad news over with: I don't know anything.<br><br>It might seem odd that an evangelist, a "bringer of truth," would confess so readily that he doesn't know anything. But the real truth of the matter is that you don't know anything either. None of us does. We dwell in a profoundly mysterious universe.<br><br>Evangelists are also supposed to bring "glad tidings of comfort and joy." The other piece of bad news is that I am going to be talking about the journey through life, and in so doing I cannot avoid talking about pain. Pain is simply a part of being human and it has been so since the Garden of Eden.<br><br>The story of the Garden of Eden is, of course, a myth. But like other myths, it is an embodiment of truth. And among the many truthful things the myth of the Garden of Eden tells us is how we human beings evolved into consciousness.<br><br>When we ate the apple from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, we became conscious, and having become conscious, we immediately became self-conscious. That was how Cod recognized that we had eaten the apple -- we were suddenly modest and shy. So one of the things this myth tells us is that it is human to be shy.<br><br>I have had the opportunity, through my career as a psychiatrist and more recently as an author and lecturer, to meet a great number of wonderful, deep-thinking people, and I have never met such a person who was not basically shy. A few of them had not thought of themselves as shy, but as we talked about it, they came to realize that they were in fact shy. And the very few people I have met who were not shy were people who had been damaged in some way, who had lost some of their humanity.<br><br>It is human to be shy, and we became shy in the Garden of Eden when we became self-conscious. When this happened to us, we became conscious of ourselves as separate entities. We lost that sense of oneness with nature, with the rest of the universe. And this loss of the sense of oneness with the rest of creation is symbolized by our banishment from Paradise.<br><br><i>GROWING UP PAINFULLY</i><br><br>When we were banished from Paradise, we were banished forever. We can never go back to Eden. If you remember the story, the way is barred by cherubims and a flaming sword.<br><br>We cannot go back. We can only go forward.<br><br>To go back to Eden would be like trying to return to our mother's womb, to infancy. Since we cannot go back to the womb or infancy, we must grow up. We can only go forward through the desert of life, making our way painfully over parched and barren ground into increasingly deeper levels of consciousness.<br><br>This is an extremely important truth because a great deal of human psychopathology, including the abuse of drugs, arises out of the attempt to get back to Eden. At cocktail parties we tend to need at least that one drink to help diminish our self-consciousness, to diminish our shyness. It works, right? And if we get Just the right amount of alcohol or Just the right amount of pot or coke or some combination thereof, for a few minutes or a few hours we may regain temporarily that lost sense of oneness with the universe. We may recapture that deliciously warm and fuzzy sense of being one with nature once again.<br><br>Of course, the feeling never lasts very long and the price usually isn't worth it. So the myth is true. We really cannot go back to Eden. We must go forward through the desert. But that journey is hard and consciousness often painful. And so most people stop their journey as quickly as they can. They find what looks like a safe place, burrow into the sand, and stay there rather than go forward through the painful desert, which is filled with cactuses and thorns and sharp rocks.<br><br>Even if most people have been taught at one time or another that "those things that hurt, instruct" (to borrow Benjamin Franklin's phrase), the education of the desert is so painful that they discontinue it as early as they can.<br><br>Senility is not just a biological disorder. It can also be a manifestation of a refusal to grow up, a psychological disorder preventable by anyone who embarks on a lifetime pattern of psychospiritual growth. Those who stop learning and growing early in their lives and stop changing and become fixed often lapse into what is sometimes called their "second childhood." They become whiny and demanding and self-centered. But this isn't because they have entered their second childhood. They have never left their first, and the veneer of adulthood is worn thin, revealing the emotional child that lurks underneath.<br><br>We psychotherapists know that most people who look like adults are actually emotional children walking around in adult's clothing. And we know this <i>not</i> because the people that come to us are more immature than most. On the contrary, those who come to psychotherapy with genuine intent to grow are those relative few who are called out of immaturity, who are no longer willing to tolerate their own childishness, although they may not yet see the way out. The rest of the population never manages to fully grow up, and perhaps it is for this reason that they hate so to talk about growing old.<br><br>Back in January of 1980, soon after I wrote <i>The Road Less Traveled,</i> which in many ways is a book about growing up, I was being driven around to a number of TV and radio stations on a promotional tour by a cabdriver in Washington, D.C. After the second or third station, he said, "Hey man, whatja doin'?"<br><br>So I told him that I was promoting a book, and he asked, "What's it about?"<br><br>I went into this intellectual bit about how it was an integration of psychiatry and religion. After about thirty seconds he commented, "Well, it sounds to me like it's about getting your shit together."<br><br>0 That man had the gift of discernment. So at the next TV talk show I went to, I asked if I could tell that story.<br><br>They said no. Thinking that they objected to the word "shit," I offered to say "stuff" instead. But they still said no.<br><br>People just don't want to talk about real maturation. It is too painful.<br><br><i>CONSTRUCTIVE SUFFERING</i><br><br>If I am willing to talk about pain, it does not mean I am some kind of masochist. On the contrary. I see absolutely no virtue whatsoever in unconstructive suffering. If I have a headache, the very first thing I do is go to the kitchen and get myself two superstrength, uncapsulized Tylenols. I see absolutely no virtue in an ordinary tension headache.<br><br>But there is such a thing as <i>constructive</i> suffering. And the difference between unconstructive suffering and constructive suffering is one of the most important things to learn in dealing with the pain of growing up. Unconstructive suffering, like headaches, is something you ought to get rid of. Constructive suffering you ought to bear and work through.<br><br>I prefer to use the terms "neurotic suffering" and "existential suffering," and here is an example of how I make that distinction. You may remember that about forty years ago, when Freud's theories first filtered down to the intelligentsia and were misinterpreted -- as so often happens -- there was a whole bunch of avant-garde parents who, having learned that guilt feelings could have something to do with neuroses, resolved that they were going to raise guilt-free children. What an awful thing to try to do to a child!<br><br>Our jails are filled with people who are there precisely because they do not have any guilt, or do not have enough guilt. We <i>need</i> a certain amount of guilt in order to exist in society. And that's what I call existential guilt.<br><br>I hasten to stress, however, that too much guilt, rather than enhancing our existence, impedes it. This is neurotic guilt. It is like walking around a golf course with eighty-seven clubs in your bag instead of fourteen, which is the number needed to play optimal golf. It's just so much excess baggage, and you ought to get rid of it as quickly as possible. If that means going into psychotherapy, then you should do that. Neurotic guilt is unnecessary, and it only impedes your journey through the desert.<br><br>This is true not only of guilt, but also of other forms of emotional suffering, like anxiety, for example, which can be either existential or neurotic. And the trick is to determine which is which.<br><br>There is a very simple albeit brutal rule for dealing with the emotional pain and suffering of life. It's a three-step process.<br><br>First, whenever you are suffering emotionally, ask yourself: "Is my suffering -- my anxiety or my guilt -- existential or is it neurotic? Is this pain enhancing my existence or is it limiting iff" Now perhaps about ten percent of the time, you really won't be able to answer that question. But about ninety percent of the time, if you can think to ask it, the answer will be very clear. If, for example, you are anxious about filing your income taxes on time because you once got hit with a big late-payment penalty, I can assure you that the anxiety you feel is existential. It's appropriate. Go with your anxiety and file on time. On the other hand, if you determine that the suffering you are experiencing is neurotic and is impeding your existence, then the second step is to ask yourself: "How would I behave if I did not have this anxiety or guilt?"<br><br>And the third step is to behave that way. As Alcoholics Anonymous teaches: "Act as if," or "Fake it to make it."<br><br>The way I first came to learn about this rule was in dealing with my own shyness. It is human to be shy, but we can deal with it in ways that are either neurotic or existential. In the audience, listening to famous speakers, I sometimes felt there was a question I should ask them, some piece of information I wanted to know, or some comment I wanted to make -- in public, or even in private after the speech. But I would hold back because I was too shy and afraid of being rejected or of looking like a fool.<br><br>After a while, I finally came to ask myself: "Is this way of dealing with your shyness -- which is holding you back from asking questions -- enhancing your existence or is it limiting it?" As soon as I asked that, it was clear that it was limiting my existence. And then I said to myself: "Well, Scotty, how would you behave if you weren't so shy? How would you behave if you were the Queen of England or President of the United States?" The answer was clear that I would approach the speaker and have my say. So then I told myself: "Okay, then, go ahead and behave that way. Fake it to make it. Act as if you weren't shy."<br><br>I admit that is a scary thing to do, but this is where courage comes in. One of the things that never cease to amaze me is how relatively few people understand what courage is. Most people think that courage is the absence of fear. The absence of fear is not courage; the absence of fear is some kind of brain damage. Courage is the capacity to go ahead in spite of the fear, or in spite of the pain. When you do that, you will find that overcoming that fear will not only make you stronger but will be a big step forward toward maturity.<br><br>Just what is maturity? When I wrote <i>The Road Less Traveled,</i> although I described a number of immature people, I never gave a definition of maturity. But it seems to me what characterizes most immature people is that they sit around complaining that life doesn't meet their demands. As Richard Bach wrote in <i>Illusions,</i> "Argue for your limitations, and sure enough they are yours." But what characterizes those relative few who are fully mature is that they regard it as their responsibility -- even as an opportunity -- to meet life's demands.<br><br><i>CONSCIOUSNESS AND HEALING</i><br><br>To proceed very far through the desert, you must be willing to meet existential suffering and work it through. In order to do that, if you are like most of us, you need to change your attitude toward pain in one way or another. And here is some good news. The quickest way to change your attitude toward pain is to accept the fact that everything that happens to us has been designed for our spiritual growth.<br><br>Donald Nichol, the author of <i>Holiness,</i> refers to it in his introduction as a how-to book. He says if you're caught carrying around a book on the subject of holiness and people ask you what you are doing with it, you're likely to tell them, "Well, I'm simply interested in what authorities have to say about the subject." Actually, Nichol points out, there's absolutely no reason for you to purchase or borrow, much less carry around a book on the subject of holiness unless you want to be holy. And so he calls it a how-to book, about how to be holy. Approximately two thirds of the way through that book there's a wonderful sentence where Nichol says, "We cannot lose once we realize that everything that happens to us has been designed to teach us holiness."<br><br>Now what better news can there be than that we cannot lose, we are bound to win? We are guaranteed winners once we simply realize that everything that happens to us has been designed to teach us what we need to know on our journey.<br><br>The problem, however, is that this realization requires a complete shift in our attitude toward pain -- and, I think, toward consciousness. Remember in the story of the Garden of Eden, we became conscious when we ate the apple from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Consciousness then became for us both the cause of our pain and the cause of our salvation, which is a word synonymous with healing.<br><br>Consciousness is the cause of our pain because, of course, were we not conscious, we would not feel pain. One of the things that we do for people to spare them unconstructive, unnecessary suffering -- physical suffering -- is to give them anesthesia so that they can lose consciousness and not feel the pain.<br><br>But while consciousness is the whole cause of pain, it is also the cause of our salvation, because salvation is the process of becoming increasingly conscious. When we become increasingly conscious, we go further and further into the desert instead of burrowing into a hole like the people who choose not to grow up. And as we travel onward, we bear more and more pain -- because of our very consciousness.<br><br>As I said above, the word <i>salvation</i> means "healing." It comes from the same word as <i>salve,</i> which you put on your skin in order to heal an area of irritation or infection. Salvation is the process of...</p><h2>The Everything Wild Game Cookbook: From Fowl And Fish to Rabbit And Venison--300 Recipes for Home-cooked Meals</h2><p>Written with the most exotic wild game and fish in mind, this unusual collection features delicious, original recipes designed to please any meat lover's palate, including:<br><ul><li>Deer, wild boar, buffalo, and bear</li><li>Pheasant, quail, and partridge</li><li>Saltwater and freshwater catch</li><li>Rubs, relishes, and marinades</li><li>Trimmings and desserts</li></ul><br>Expert author Karen Eagle also reveals the secrets of cooking wild game, from the various techniques for preparing it (such as roasting and smoking) to substitutions that really work.

These novellas read like a nuanced conversation between author and character. . . . Masterful.&#x201d; David Ulin, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jim Harrison is one of America&#x2019;s most beloved writers. Of all his creations, Brown Dog has earned cult status with readers in the more than two decades since his first appearance, scrambling to stay out of jail after his salvage-diving operation uncovers the frozen body of an Indian man in the waters of Lake Superior. A <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Book of the Year, now in paperback, this book gathers together all the Brown Dog novellas, including one that has never been published.<br><br>Brown Dog is a bawdy, reckless, down-on-his-luck Michigan Indian, a former pulp cutter who looks on work as something to do when he needs money, far inferior to the pleasures of fishing. Of course, the flip side of this is that he&#x2019;s never far from catastrophe. Overindulging in food, drink, and women while just scraping by, B.D. meets a nubile archaeologist who presses him for the location of a sacred Native American burial ground; the ensuing flirtation with radicalization results in B.D. wandering Los Angeles in search of a stolen bearskin. When he returns home a little older and wiser, B.D. will seek out family and end up pining for the lesbian social worker who&#x2019;s pushing him toward stability. The collection culminates with He Dog,&#x201d; written for this book, which finds B.D. still marginally employed and looking for love (or sometimes just a few beers and a roll in the hay) as he goes on a road trip from Michigan to Montana and back, in search of an answer to the riddle of family and, perhaps, a chance at redemption.<br><br>Witty and poignantly human, <i>Brown Dog</i> underscores Harrison&#x2019;s place as one of America&#x2019;s most irrepressible writers, and one of our finest practitioners of the novella form. It is the ideal introduction (or reintroduction) to Harrison&#x2019;s irresistible everyman.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2013:</strong> <br> Brown Dog is a maddeningly simple man. As long as he&#x2019;s got a few crumpled dollars, or a dog by his side, or a bottle at hand, or a woman in his bed, he&#x2019;s just fine. Ever since I was introduced to Harrison&#x2019;s part-Native American alter ego twenty-plus years ago (in <em>The Woman Lit By Fireflies</em>), B.D. has felt familiar. He reminds me of my brother, of high school friends, of an alternate version of myself. B.D. is universal, a likeable doofus, an Everyman skirt-and-booze chaser, all <em>id</em> all the time. So why does he feel like one of the more complex characters in modern literature? Maybe it&#x2019;s got something to do with the leavening offset of strong female characters, one of whom scolds B.D.: &#x201c;You think each day is a fresh start, which it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Or maybe it&#x2019;s the looming breadth and beauty of Harrison&#x2019;s playground, the dark and piney Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a version of Faulkner&#x2019;s Yoknapatawpha County. Across numerous books and many years, Harrrison has rarely veered far from the life of B.D., who can display &#x201c;the warrior&#x2019;s courage of four beers&#x201d; one moment and weep at the memory of a childhood dog the next. In these six novellas--one never before published--Harrison reminds us that he&#x2019;s still vibrant, still a voice for the underdog, still a true literary original. Writers like this just don't come around very often. And enduring characters like Brown Dog--a little bit Huck Finn, a little bit Don Quixote--come around even less frequently. --<em>Neal Thompson</em><b>Jim Harrison</b> is the author of thirty-five previous books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall</i>, <i>The Road Home</i>, <i>Returning to Earth</i>, and <i>The English Major</i>.

In 1980, beautiful Gina Renee Hall, a Radford University freshman, went to a Virginia Tech nightclub on a Saturday night. She was never seen again. Her abandoned car was found parked beneath a railroad trestle bridging the New River, with blood in the trunk. The investigation led police to a secluded cabin on Claytor Lake, where there was evidence of a violent attack. Former Virginia Tech football player Stephen Epperly was charged with murder, despite the fact that Gina&#x2019;s body was never found. In Virginia&#x2019;s &#x201c;trial of the century,&#x201d; prosecutor Everett Shockley presented an entirely circumstantial case. Key witnesses against Epperly included his best friend, his mother and a tracking dog handler later believed by many to be a fraud. Three former Virginia Tech football players testified, including a Hokies quarterback once featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Would Epperly become the first person in Virginia history convicted of murder without the victim&#x2019;s body, an eyewitness or a confession? And would authorities ever find the body of Gina Renee Hall?</p><p></p><h2>As Silver Refined: Answers to Life&#39;s Disappointments</h2><p><p>What Can You Do When Life Doesn&#x2019;t Turn Out Like You Planned?<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>How do you respond when your husband or wife tramples your emotions?&nbsp; When your boss fires you unexpectedly?&nbsp; When you lose your life&#x2019;s savings?&nbsp; When the child you&#x2019;ve loved and prayed for turns his back on you and your values?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>When disappointments like these smash their way into your life, you may want to scream, &#x201c;How could God let this happen?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But what if God didn&#x2019;t just &#x201c;let it happen&#x201d;?&nbsp; What if the things you call <i>disappointments</i> are really <i>His appointments</i>&#x2014;events He is using to make you more like Christ?&nbsp; What if your circumstances are actually the flames of His grace, intended to melt and burn away the undesirable elements in your life, leaving you pure and radiant&#x2014;like refined silver?<br>&nbsp;<br>You can be defeated by life&#x2019;s unavoidable disappointments, or you can become stronger because of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Life&#x2019;s disappointments can send you on a dangerous downward spiral into discouragement, depression, or even despair.&nbsp; But in this eye-opening book, Kay Arthur guides you to biblical truths that will help you break that cycle and instead embrace disappointment as the cleansing fire God uses to make you&#x2014;as silver refined&#x2014;a reflection of His goodness.<br><br>Now includes a 16 week Bible study!</p></p><p>Will life's disappointments destroy you--or make you stronger?<br><br>Everyone faces disappointments, trials, and struggles.

The <strong>Second Edition </strong>continues to provide an accessible roadmap that honors the complexity of action research, while providing an overview of how action research is defined, its traditions and history, and the rationale for using it. Authors Kathryn Herr and Gary L.

After all, the image is upside-down and everything appears, well, reversed. How can you possibly work with such inverted symbols?</p> <p>Zach Wong has come up with the ultimate solution. He presents different symbolism on the bottom part of the card, so it appears upright when the card is inverted. This is like having a 156-card deck while only using 78 cards.</p> <p>There is much more to this deck than just ease with reading reversals. All of the characters wear masks. This shows them to be similar to mythical deities who assume human form and stand among us to make their spiritual messages easier for us to understand. Similarly, they make the message of the cards easier to comprehend.</p> <p>These cards, with their stained glass imagery, match the traditional RWS interpretations. Wong, however, has added his own twists that energize and add additional meaning to the RWS concepts. You can bring these additional insights into your divinations with any Tarot.</p> <p>This is a beautiful, unique, and powerful deck that matches and expands upon traditional Tarot ideas. The new realizations and revelations you'll get when you use this deck for divination or meditation validate the name and give another reason for you to use this deck regularly. Ideal for meditation, study, and divination, treat this deck as something special...because it is!</p> <p></p></p><p>Zach Wong (Australia) grew up in Malaysia where he studied Western and Asian mythology. He has a degree in architecture and works in illustration/graphic design. The art featured in Revelations Tarot will be exhibited in local galleries and on his website. <br> <br><p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;A brilliantly colored, imaginative deck that solves one of the most difficult problems of the Tarot, dealing with reversals, by making all of the illustrations two-sided, revealing the message whether the card is upright or inverted. Ideal for beginners, people seeking added insight, and for those who enjoy the quirky, illustrated novel or manga-like artwork of Zach Wong.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>In-Depth Review:</strong></p> <p>One of the primary difficulties in reading Tarot cards is what to do with cards that come up reversed or inverted. Some people simply right the cards and ignore reversals. One of the great contemporary writers on Tarot, Mary K. Greer, has an entire book,&nbsp;<em>The Complete Book of Tarot Reversals</em>, that is exclusively on this subject.&nbsp;<br><br>The problem is that when you have a card that is upside-down, the image, with all of its symbols, is also upside-down. Some people simply give the opposite meaning of the card. Of course, this requires you to memorize the meaning of the card and then reverse the meaning&#x2015;you can&#x2019;t simply look at the symbols. Some people have decidedly different meanings for cards that are reversed from the meaning when they are upright. Other give an interpretation where the meaning of the inverted card is the same as when it's upright, just lessened in its impact. No matter what your solution, reversed cards are still a problem.&nbsp;<br><br>Zach Wong has come up with what may be the best solution to this problem ever in his&nbsp;<em>Revelations Tarot</em>. What he simply does is have different symbolism on the bottom part of the card, so it appears upright when the card is inverted. This is such an obvious and very simple solution it's surprising that nobody came up with it before. The result is that although you have a deck that follows the RWS tradition very closely, for all practical purposes you have a deck with 156 cards!&nbsp;<br><br>The Major Arcana cards have two other features, beside their 2-way art, that is fascinating. First, there is a quality of stained glass in all the cards. Second, all of the characters are wearing masks. This, according to Wong, shows them to be similar to "that of the mythical gods who stand in human form amongst us to ease our comprehension of the messages they deliver."&nbsp;<br><br>The art is incredibly deep and complex. The colors are striking, deep, and gorgeous, so much so that you could get lost in it. Therefore, it&#x2019;s important to understand that although this deck is modeled after the RWS, it is <em>not</em> an RWS clone and necessitates a study of the cards in order to fully appreciate all of their potential. In this it is similar to some aspects of the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck. The symbolism is also very deep. However, with the Thoth deck the depth is sometimes hidden in the seeming simplicity of the images. Here, the complexity is out in the open. Studying this deck can be highly rewarding, and to really give good readings with this deck, you should spend time studying this deck. With the readings you'll get from it you'll see any study is worth it.<br><br>The Minor Arcana also have that stained glass feel. They have more action and swirling, succulent energy than the rather staid RWS deck. Although the meanings of all the Minors match the RWS, Wong adds his own twists that energize and add additional meaning to the RWS concepts. This is very valuable. The cards don&#x2019;t contradict what you may know of the RWS, they add to it. The wisdom of Wong, as manifested in this deck, can then be brought back to the RWS and similar decks.&nbsp;<br><br>The book that comes with this deck, The&nbsp;<em>Revelations Tarot Companion,</em>&nbsp;features a brief introduction covering how Wong came to create the deck, explanations of the meanings of the cards and their symbolism, and explanations of three spreads.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is thorough, but doesn&#x2019;t reveal everything; it just whets your appetite. It gives you just enough to get you started, to draw you in, to investigate the meanings and potentials of this deck.&nbsp;<br><br>The&nbsp;<em>Revelations Tarot</em>&nbsp;is not just another Tarot deck. It is an experience. Work with it and it will advance your reading skills and spiritual development. Take a look at this deck. If the art appeals to you get this deck. You may find it will become your regular reading deck, or at least a deck you&#x2019;ll drift back to again and again.</p> <p><strong>Name of deck:&nbsp;</strong><em>Revelations Tarot</em><br><strong>Publisher:</strong>&nbsp;Llewellyn Worldwide&nbsp;<br><strong>ISBN:</strong>&nbsp;0-7387-0607-8&nbsp;<br><strong>Creator&#x2019;s name:</strong>&nbsp;Zach Wong&nbsp;<br><strong>Name of accompanying book:&nbsp;</strong><em>Revelations Tarot Companion</em><br><strong>Number of pages of book:</strong>&nbsp;216&nbsp;<br><strong>Author of book:</strong>&nbsp;Zach Wong&nbsp;<br><strong>Brief biography of author:</strong>&nbsp;Zach Wong (Australia) grew up in Malaysia where he studied Western and Asian mythology.

The many images, metaphors and symbolism that could be found in the various decks available&#x2015;traditional and contemporary&#x2015;failed to connect with my being.&nbsp;<br><br>"I grew weary of my journey trying to find the one deck, which I could do my own readings with and decided to venture on a project of creating my own. Here each card would have it&#x2019;s own meaning, particular to myself as well as incorporate the language of the Tarot.&nbsp;<br><br>"With the aid of my the&nbsp;<em>Rider-Waite [-Smith]</em>&nbsp;deck and text such as that from Jane Lyle and Rachel Pollack I spent many nights drawing the detailed line work which became the basis of the Tarot cards. Over the years the illustration style grew more confident and bolder. When it finally came to the coloring stage of the cards, I surprised myself with the wonders of bold colors and vibrant hues. Each artistic layer of the card added to the meaning and the evocation of my own consciousness."&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Ten Little Mermaids (Counting to Ten Books)</h2><p><p>Each time a page is turned a colorful mermaid disappears, encouraging children to learn to count as they read the simple story and find out where each mermaid has gone to!

A former<em> New York Times</em> art director and illustrator of the newspaper&#x2019;s &#x2018;Modern Love&#x2019; column, Rea has a talent for capturing deep emotions in loose drawings, using bright colors and strong graphic composition to convey the expressions of a character whose face is a gray circle.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><em>The A.V.

What he finds ranges from the utterly disappointing to the transcendentally joyous&#x2014;but it is always and ever a testament to the value of encountering new things and people. Rea&#x2019;s work is rendered in warm, friendly hues: lemon meringue roller coasters and coral-colored speedboats predominate. Undergirding these cheerful shades is an earnest appeal to that most human of questions: how should one live?

Sinclair wrote the novel to portray the harsh conditions and exploited lives of immigrants in the United States in Chicago and similar industrialized cities. However, most readers were more concerned with his exposure of health violations and unsanitary practices in the American meatpacking industry during the early 20th century, based on an investigation he did for a socialist newspaper.The book depicts working class poverty, the lack of social supports, harsh and unpleasant living and working conditions, and a hopelessness among many workers. These elements are contrasted with the deeply rooted corruption of people in power. A review by the writer Jack London called it, "the Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery".Sinclair was considered a muckraker, or journalist who exposed corruption in government and business.He first published the novel in serial form in 1905, in the Socialist newspaper, Appeal to Reason, between February 25, 1905 and November 4, 1905. In 1904, Sinclair had spent seven weeks gathering information while working incognito in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper. It was published as a book on February 26, 1906, by Doubleday and in a subscribers' edition.A film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has since become lost.</p><p>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.<p>An ardent activist, champion of political reform, novelist, and progressive journalist, Upton Sinclair is perhaps best known today for <i>The Jungle</i> his devastating expose of the meat-packing industry. A protest novel he privately published in 1906, the book was a shocking revelation of intolerable labor practices and unsanitary working conditions in the Chicago stockyards. It quickly became a bestseller, arousing public sentiment and resulting in such federal legislation as the Pure Food and Drug Act.-The brutally grim story of a Slavic family who emigrates to America, <i>The Jungle</i> tells of their rapid and inexorable descent into numbing poverty, moral degradation, and social and economic despair. Vulnerable and isolated, the family of Jurgis Rudkus struggles unsuccessfully to survive in an urban jungle.<br>A powerful view of turn-of-the-century poverty, graft, and corruption, this fiercely realistic American classic is still required reading in many history and literature classes.

Truman committed a gaffe that sent shock waves around the world, when he suggested that General Douglas MacArthur, the willful, fearless, and highly decorated commander of the American and U.N. forces, had his finger on the nuclear trigger. At a time when the Soviets, too, had the bomb, the specter of a catastrophic third World War lurked menacingly close on the horizon. A correction quickly followed, but the damage was done; two visions for America&#x2019;s path forward were clearly in opposition, and one man would have to make way.<br><br>The contest of wills between these two titanic characters unfolds against the turbulent backdrop of a faraway war and terrors conjured at home by Joseph McCarthy. From the drama of Stalin&#x2019;s blockade of West Berlin to the daring landing of MacArthur&#x2019;s forces at Inchon to the shocking entrance of China into the war, <i>The General and the President</i> vividly evokes the making of a new American era.</p></p><p>H. W. BRANDS holds the Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair in History at the University of Texas at Austin. A <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in biography for <i>The First American</i> and <i>Traitor to His Class</i>.The General vs. the President<br>PROLOGUE<br><br>December 1950<br><br>Clement Attlee didn&#x2019;t like appearing flustered. The British prime minister&#x2019;s predecessor, Winston Churchill, was the one who indulged in dramatics: the speeches about blood, sweat and tears; finest hours; Iron Curtains. Attlee had evicted Churchill from 10&nbsp;Downing Street at the end of World War&nbsp;II in no small part because the British people wanted less drama and more predictability. Yet the sudden news from America had even Attlee sweating. The House of Commons was debating the optimal course of British foreign policy when the BBC brought word that Harry Truman was brandishing the atom bomb against China. This itself horrified the British lawmakers. The American president was the only person in history who had ordered the use of the monstrous weapon, and a man who had atom-bombed Japan might, without additional scruple, do the same to China. But there was a crucial new element, these five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that made the prospect still more appalling. The Russians had the bomb, too, and were China&#x2019;s allies. A nuclear war in 1950 would not be one-sided. <br><br>And there was something else, something that pushed the alarm level in Britain far past that of any previous Cold War crisis. By Truman&#x2019;s own statement, the decision on use of the atom bomb rested with the American field commander in Korea, Douglas MacArthur. Attlee and many others in Britain could think of no one more frightening than MacArthur to have control of the bomb. MacArthur was brilliant, brave&nbsp;and imaginative&#x2014;even his critics granted that. But the general had isolated himself so long in Asia, and surrounded himself with such sycophants, that he had lost all perspective. He suffered from an extreme version of the theater commander&#x2019;s habit of thinking his own region the pivot of any conflict. During World War&nbsp;II MacArthur had behaved as though fascism would triumph or be defeated according to the outcome of battle in the Pacific; in the Cold War he contended that communism would win or lose depending on what happened in Asia. He had chafed at the communist victory in China&#x2019;s civil war, now a year past. The outbreak of fighting in Korea five months ago had given him his chance to engage the communists, and the sudden entry of China into the conflict, just a week ago, had raised the stakes dramatically. MacArthur seemed to relish the opportunity to smash the communists, using whatever weapons were available. And now Truman was making the ultimate weapon available.<br><br>The House of Commons burst into an uproar on hearing the word from Washington. Members of Attlee&#x2019;s Labour party, already convinced that the Americans were reckless and MacArthur was a maniac, threatened a mutiny against their prime minister for his support of the American-led effort in Korea. To quell the uprising, Attlee announced that he would travel to America. He implied that he would talk sense and restraint into Truman. But he knew, and they knew, that this was more than he could guarantee. The mutiny hung fire, stemmed for the moment yet hardly vanquished.<br><br>Britain&#x2019;s alarm was broadly shared. None of the countries that had supported the United States in the defense of South Korea had bargained on the fighting there triggering World War&nbsp;III. The French distrusted MacArthur even more than the British did, and made no secret of the fact. The French National Assembly called for immediate negotiations to defuse the crisis in Korea. French premier Ren� Pleven hastened to London to meet Attlee before the British prime minister left for Washington, and to lend his voice to those insisting that the Americans refrain from rash moves. Fear of the bomb united rightist and leftist parties in Italy, where protesters branded Truman a war criminal. West German officials, on the front line of the Cold War in Europe, refused to comment publicly but privately said America&#x2019;s use of the bomb against China would almost certainly compel a Russian response, probably against&nbsp;them. India&#x2019;s government, which earlier had conveyed a warning from Beijing that the Chinese would enter the Korean conflict if MacArthur insisted on sending U.S. troops to the Korean-Chinese border&#x2014;a warning MacArthur had airily dismissed&#x2014;now predicted that a resort to greater force would provoke a cataclysm. Pope Pius XII urged Catholics to pray that the world might be spared.<br><br>Americans shuddered as well. &#x201c;Is it World War&nbsp;III?&#x201d; asked the New York Times. The paper didn&#x2019;t say yes, but it couldn&#x2019;t say no. New Yorkers flooded the civil-defense offices of the city and state with demands to know where they should seek refuge when the Russian bombs began falling. The state director of civil defense tried to calm things but only made them worse when he said his office was operating &#x201c;on the basis that an atomic or other attack could take place at any time.&#x201d; The response in other cities and states was much the same.&nbsp;<br><br>Members of Congress displayed caution about criticizing the president for standing up to the communists; none wanted to get into the crosshairs of Joseph McCarthy, at the peak of his red-baiting power. But several took pains to assert that the pertinent legislation gave authority over the use of the bomb to the president alone, not to any general. Nonpoliticians were less leery. Clergy and educators implored Truman to refrain from the terrible step he seemed to be contemplating. Frederick Nolde, speaking for the World Council of Churches, declared, &#x201c;We would veritably be playing into the hands of those who want to pin upon us the tangible responsibility for starting a world war.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>If the world was alarmed, Harry Truman was livid. And he blamed Douglas MacArthur for getting him into this mess. In his five years as president, Truman had tolerated repeated slights and affronts from MacArthur: the general&#x2019;s habit of making pronouncements on matters beyond his military responsibilities, his failure to return to America to brief the government on the U.S. occupation of Japan, his campaigning for president in 1948 without bothering to resign his command. Truman had suppressed his anger, lest a public row between the president and the general threaten the precarious stability of the Far East. When MacArthur had refused to travel more than half a day from his headquarters in Tokyo to discuss the war in Korea, Truman had undertaken the long&nbsp;journey to Wake Island. There he heard the general state with utter selfassurance that the Chinese would never dare to enter the Korean fighting. If they did, they would be obliterated.<br><br>A month later the Chinese entered the war. And they proceeded to manhandle MacArthur&#x2019;s army. Truman was stunned and outraged. How could MacArthur not have seen this coming? Had his arrogance simply blinded him?<br><br>MacArthur&#x2019;s horrendous misjudgment had put Truman in an impossible position. Since 1945 the president had been walking a knife-edge of decision between appeasement and war: between yielding to communist pressure and tipping the planet into a new world conflict. In 1946 a stern warning had sufficed to keep the Kremlin from grabbing Iran. In 1947 a stronger dose of American power, in the form of military aid to Greece and Turkey, had preserved the Balkans from a communist takeover. A massive airlift in 1948 had kept Berlin free. The North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 made clear to Moscow that an attack on any of America&#x2019;s allies would be met with the full force of America&#x2019;s arsenal. Billions of dollars of Marshall Plan money continued to pour into Europe to bolster democracy there.&nbsp;<br><br>The North Korean attack on South Korea in June&nbsp;1950 proved that the communists never rested. Truman had responded with measured force, enough to secure South Korea yet not so much as to bring the Soviets into the conflict. But then MacArthur&#x2019;s recklessness had provoked the Chinese to enter the fight. The Soviets, linked to the Chinese by a military pact, and as opportunistic as ever, wouldn&#x2019;t miss a chance to jump the United States where America&#x2019;s alliances were most vulnerable, should the Asian war escalate further. And further escalation was exactly what MacArthur was demanding.&nbsp;<br><br>The knife-edge that Truman had been walking suddenly terminated above an abyss. He couldn&#x2019;t go forward without risking a nuclear World War&nbsp;III. He couldn&#x2019;t retreat without undermining the morale of all who looked to America for leadership of the forces resisting communism. MacArthur had drastically narrowed the president&#x2019;s options, and the general had the gall to complain that <i>his </i>hands were being tied.&nbsp;<br><br>Reporters had heard of MacArthur&#x2019;s complaints; they knew they had a story. They asked Truman for a response. What measures would he authorize the general to employ to fend off the Chinese?&nbsp;<br><br>Truman didn&#x2019;t want to answer this question, not least because he&nbsp;hadn&#x2019;t decided. Anyway, as a poker player he knew not to tip his hand. But as a Democratic president harassed by Republicans for softness on communism, he judged he had to say something. &#x201c;We will take whatever steps are necessary,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Will that include the atomic bomb?&#x201d; a reporter asked. <br>&#x201c;That includes every weapon we have.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does that mean that there is active consideration of the use of the atomic bomb?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There has always been active consideration of its use.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>This was huge news. Never had the president spoken so openly about using the bomb. Another reporter wanted to be sure he had heard Truman correctly. &#x201c;Did we understand you clearly that the use of the atomic bomb is under active consideration?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Always has been,&#x201d; Truman said curtly. &#x201c;It is one of our weapons.&#x201d; <br>How would the decision on use be made? <br>&#x201c;The military commander in the field will have charge of the use of the weapons, as he always has.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>This was even bigger news. MacArthur&#x2019;s finger was on the nuclear trigger. The reporters scrambled to file their stories. The shock waves rolled around the world.&nbsp;<br><br>As the extent of the alarm echoed back to Washington, Truman&#x2019;s advisers urged him to let the White House issue a clarification. Truman agreed, but grudgingly, for he prided himself on plain speaking. The clarification stated that use of the atom bomb had been under consideration since the start of hostilities in Korea; whenever the United States went to war, all weapons were considered. As to who would make the basic, strategic decision to use the bomb, that would be the president. Tactical choices about where and when the bomb would be used would be left to the military commander in the field.&nbsp;<br><br>The clarification didn&#x2019;t alleviate the alarm, for it didn&#x2019;t materially revise Truman&#x2019;s own words. The president was considering the use of the bomb, and MacArthur would determine the time and place.&nbsp;<br><br>Truman cursed his bad luck, and he cursed MacArthur. The last thing he wanted was to have to use atomic weapons. He claimed not to have lost sleep over the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but no one takes the deaths of a hundred thousand civilians lightly. He hoped not to have to make such a decision again. And this time the consequences would be far more terrible. World War&nbsp;II had ended with atomic bombings; World War&nbsp;III would begin with them. But he couldn&#x2019;t back down. The Chinese were watching. The Russians were watching. Americans were watching. The world was watching.<br><br>Now Attlee was coming. Truman hated being on the spot like this: having to explain that he wasn&#x2019;t intending to start another world war, yet having to avoid seeming fearful or reluctant to oppose the communists.<br><br>And it was MacArthur&#x2019;s doing. Truman couldn&#x2019;t decide whether the general was the damnedest fool in the army, which had its share of fools, or the canniest political operator he had ever tangled with. Truman had to admit that MacArthur had outmaneuvered him, placing him on the brink of a broader war against China, when that was the last place he wanted to be.&nbsp;<br>Douglas MacArthur, sitting calmly in his office on the top floor of the Dai Ichi Building in central Tokyo, wondered what all the fuss was about. MacArthur disdained politicians as a class, whether prime ministers or presidents. He believed politicians lacked the knowledge or nerve to make the decisions national safety required. He had dealt with presidents for decades and not found one who didn&#x2019;t falter at the moment of truth or put partisan self-interest ahead of the country&#x2019;s interest. This was why he had kept his distance from Washington. His deliberate exile was in its sixteenth year; he had resisted repeated requests from the White House to come home, and he would continue to resist them as long as he could. His work was more important than what consumed the office seekers. He had guided the Philippines to independence; he had defeated imperial Japan and was building a republican Japan. For the last five months he had been holding the line against communism in Korea.&nbsp;<br><br>He was on the verge of doing much more. Since 1945 freedom had been in retreat; communism had captured Eastern Europe and then China. It had come close to engulfing all of Korea. But there he had made a stand and subsequently sent the communists reeling. His success was no thanks to Washington, where the president and his advisers had fretted and quavered until he&#x2014;Douglas MacArthur&#x2014;had taken the responsibility upon himself and plunged ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>In short order he accomplished what no one else&#x2014;no president, no general&#x2014;had accomplished during the Cold War, rolling back the red&nbsp;tide and reclaiming territory previously lost to communism. And once more he defied the fretters, who didn&#x2019;t want to upset the communists of China. He again assumed responsibility and ordered his troops to the Korean border with China.<br><br>It was then that the Chinese entered the war, causing everyone in Washington&#x2014;and London and several other world capitals, apparently&#x2014;to run for cover. MacArthur took the new development in stride. He admitted that he hadn&#x2019;t expected such large numbers of Chinese to appear in Korea. But what the politicians interpreted as a mauling he accounted the cost of springing the Chinese trap. He had foiled the communists&#x2019; plan to annihilate his army; he was retreating but stretching their supply lines and rendering them vulnerable to his airpower. He now had the communists just where he wanted them.&nbsp;<br><br>All that was required was nerve in Washington. He didn&#x2019;t expect it to appear unprompted. Harry Truman was no less the political animal than Franklin Roosevelt, whom MacArthur had had to educate during World War&nbsp;II. Truman might be educated, too. The general took encouragement from the president&#x2019;s remarks about the atom bomb; maybe he <i>did </i>see what was at stake in Korea. Would he follow through? Could he stand up to Attlee and the others who would beseech him to step back? Time would tell.&nbsp;<br><br>Was it World War&nbsp;III? Not yet. But if a lifetime at arms had taught Douglas MacArthur anything, it was that an inordinate fear of war was the surest guarantor of war. Hadn&#x2019;t the democracies learned anything from Hitler? Appeasement of the fascists had caused World War&nbsp; II; appeasement of the communists would cause World War&nbsp;III.

It covered her yellow-gold hair and small brown shoes. It hid everything about her, except two laughing blue eyes, which peered out of two round holes.<br> <br>She said, &#x201c;Boooooo,&#x201d; at Mr. Doon, her father.

Not quite.<br> <br>In the middle of the night Lucinda woke up with a start. She heard a strange noise outside the window. It sounded like somebody crying. Or perhaps like somebody trying not to cry.<br> <br>It was pitch-dark now. But Lucinda got out of bed and turned on the light and opened the window.<br> <br>There, on the branch of the big bare mulberry tree, sat a bedraggled little witch! She wore a peaked hat. She had big staring eyes. And something like a raindrop ran down her face and fell off the tip of her pointed nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; cried Lucinda.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a witch, as you should plainly see,&#x201d; said the little witch crossly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you crying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not crying.&#x201d; The little witch rubbed her eyes with the back of her fist. &#x201c;I broke my broom and fell from the sky,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And the sky was wet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you going to get home?&#x201d; asked Lucinda anxiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I knew that, I wouldn&#x2019;t be sitting in this tree,&#x201d; snapped the strange little creature. &#x201c;But I do know one thing&#x2014;if I don&#x2019;t get back up there before the sun rises, I&#x2019;ll have to stay on the ground for a whole year. Till next Halloween.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucinda was almost sure she saw another tear. But she was too kind to mention it. She said, &#x201c;Maybe I can help you. Mother has a brand-new broom. If you will come inside you may test it and see if it will fly.&#x201d;<br> <br>The big branch was very near the window. Lucinda held out her arms and helped the little witch crawl inside the room.<br> <br>Itchabody the cat came out from under the bed. He arched his back and his fur stood up like pins when he saw the visitor. &#x201c;Meeeow!&#x201d; he said whiningly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I pull cats&#x2019; tails,&#x201d; said the little witch.<br> <br>Itchabody backed away, hissing. But as Lucinda and the witch crept down the stairs to the broom closet, the cat scampered past them.

The story features the fictional ocean liner Titan, which sinks in the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg. The Titan and its sinking have been noted to be very similar to the real-life passenger ship RMS Titanic, which sank fourteen years later. Following the wreck, the novel was reissued with some changes, particularly in the ship's gross tonnage. The first half of Futility introduces the hero John Rowland. Rowland is a disgraced former US Navy officer. Now an alcoholic fallen to the lowest levels of society, he's been dismissed from the Navy and works as a deckhand on the Titan. One April night the ship hits an iceberg, sinking somewhat before the halfway point of the novel. The second half follows Rowland. He saves the young daughter of a former lover by jumping onto the iceberg with her. The pair find a lifeboat washed up on the iceberg, and are eventually rescued by a passing ship. But the girl is recovered by her mother and Rowland is arrested for her kidnapping. A sympathetic magistrate discharges him and rebukes the mother for unsympathy to her daughter's savior. Rowland disappears from the world.</p><p><p>Morgan Robertson was an American writer best known for his novel Futility, or The Wreck of the Titan, a prescient novel published in 1898 about the catastrophic sinking of an unsinkable ocean liner, eerily similar to the sinking of the Titanic fourteen years later. Robertson also penned The Submarine Destroyer, Three Laws and the Golden Rule, and the short story Beyond the Spectrum, which described a future war between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Morgan Robertson died in 1915.</p></p><h2>Detective Dinosaur (I Can Read Level 2)</h2><p><p><strong>Meet comically clueless Detective Dinosaur and his loyal sidekick, Officer Pterodactyl, in this first of three hilarious misadventures from the crack team of author James Skofield and illustrator R.

Generations of children all over the world have grown up spending hours poring over his books filled with all the colorful details of their daily lives. No other illustrator has shown such a lively interest in the words and concepts of early childhood. (Whenever he was asked how old he was, Scarry would always put up one hand and laugh, saying, "five!")&nbsp;<br><br>Born in 1919, Richard Scarry was raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his work. The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually, Scarry created his own original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic classic&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print. His books have sold over 100 million copies around the world and are currently published in more than twenty languages. Richard Scarry Jr., also an illustrator, carries on his father's work today under the name of Huck Scarry. Richard Scarry passed away at his home in Gstaad, Switzerland in 1994. He was posthumously awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Illustrators in 2012.</p><h2>Jane Crow</h2><p>Throughout her prodigious life, activist and lawyer Pauli Murray systematically fought against all arbitrary distinctions in society, channeling her outrage at the discrimination she faced to make America a more democratic country. In this definitive biography, Rosalind Rosenberg offers a poignant portrait of a figure who played pivotal roles in both the modern civil rights and women's movements. <br><br>A mixed-race orphan, Murray grew up in segregated North Carolina before escaping to New York, where she attended Hunter College and became a labor activist in the 1930s. When she applied to graduate school at the University of North Carolina, where her white great-great-grandfather had been a trustee, she was rejected because of her race. She went on to graduate first in her class at Howard Law School, only to be rejected for graduate study again at Harvard University this time on account of her sex. Undaunted, Murray forged a singular career in the law. In the 1950s, her legal scholarship helped Thurgood Marshall challenge segregation head-on in the landmark <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> case. <br><br>When appointed by Eleanor Roosevelt to the President's Commission on the Status of Women in 1962, she advanced the idea of Jane Crow, arguing that the same reasons used to condemn race discrimination could be used to battle gender discrimination. In 1965, she became the first African American to earn a JSD from Yale Law School and the following year persuaded Betty Friedan to found an NAACP for women, which became NOW. In the early 1970s, Murray provided Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the argument Ginsburg used to persuade the Supreme Court that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution protects not only blacks but also women - and potentially other minority groups - from discrimination. By that time, Murray was a tenured history professor at Brandeis, a position she left to become the first black woman ordained a priest by the Episcopal Church in 1976.<br><br>Murray accomplished all this while struggling with issues of identity. She believed from childhood she was male and tried unsuccessfully to persuade doctors to give her testosterone. While she would today be identified as transgender, during her lifetime no social movement existed to support this identity. She ultimately used her private feelings of being "in-between" to publicly contend that identities are not fixed, an idea that has powered campaigns for equal rights in the United States for the past half-century.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rosalind Rosenberg</strong> is Professor of History Emerita at Barnard College, Columbia University. She is the author of <em>Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century</em>, <em>Changing the Subject: How the Women of Columbia Shaped the Way We Think About Sex and Politics</em>, and <em>Beyond Separate Spheres:</em> <em>Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism</em>.<br><br>"Rosenberg brilliantly situates Murray at the forefront of post-WW II civil and women's rights movements....This major contribution to African American history and queer studies sheds light on Murray's lifelong struggles with gender identity. The feminist scholar and Episcopal priest identified as a man, established relationships with women, donned men's clothes, and during the 1930s unsuccessfully underwent hormone therapy in order to transition from female to male. A stellar and fascinating monograph that celebrates Murray's lesser-known accomplishments.

Her striking interpretive work clearly shows what Murray herself suspected: that everything Murray did was 'part of history...an instrument for achieving things.'"--<em>Foreword Reviews</em><p></p><br>"A fascinating look at the incredible life of Pauli Murray, a mixed-race, transgender scholar, lawyer, activist, priest, and trailblazer who played a pivotal role in the civil rights and women's movements of the 20th century."--<em>The Advocate</em><p></p><br>"A splendid definitive biography....This thorough investigation into Murray's life is fascinating, as the author traces the intersection among gender, race, and politics."--<em>Library Journal</em>, Starred Review<p></p><br>"Historical figures aren't human flotsam, swirling into public awareness at random intervals. Instead, they are almost always borne back to us on the current of our own times. In Murray's case, it's not simply that her public struggles on behalf of women, minorities, and the working class suddenly seem more relevant than ever. It's that her private struggles--documented for the first time in all their fullness by Rosenberg--have recently become our public ones."--<em>New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"A compelling read from start to finish....Like all the best biographies, this is more than just the story of a single figure. It is the story of America, told through the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality that have come to define it....Rosenberg's <em>Jane Crow</em> makes not only an important contribution to the fields of Black, feminist, and trans history, but also offers us the timely reminder that, as Murray herself once wrote, 'one person and a typewriter make a movement.'"--<em>Lambda Literary</em><p></p><br>"A fresh perspective on this crucial slice of history."--<em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Review</em><p></p><br>"Rosenberg's research is thorough, and her lively style keeps readers engaged....[A]n edifying and enjoyable read."--<em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"Beautifully crafted...[<em>Jane Crow</em>] underscore[s] the pleasures of biography as history."--Eileen Boris, <em>The American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Rosenberg has done the world an immense favor by presenting, in all its triumph and pathos, the life (or perhaps 'lives' is more accurate) of this brilliant and defiant African-American."--<em>National Catholic Review</em><p></p><br>"Meticulously researched, expansive in its coverage of Murray's many achievements, engagingly written overall, Rosenberg has given us the means to a greater appreciation of this most remarkable American, and provides a foundation for even further conversation about her significance and legacy."--<em>North Carolina Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"Rosenberg has delivered an insightful, sensitive, and long-overdue biography that gives Murray her rightful place among the twentieth century's most important civil rights activitists."--Jeffrey J. Crow, <em>North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Rosalind Rosenberg's <em>Jane Crow: The Life of Pauli Murray</em> is a highly readable account of Murray's intense and life-long battle to confront social issues bound up in the entangled threads of race, sexuality, gender, and class... Her narrative has an immediacy that seamlessly connects Murray's personal and public lives."--<em>Southern Register</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Jane Crow</em> does justice to the powerful mind and personal pain of Pauli Murray and to the momentous events she had a hand in bringing to pass. This is a book that asks us to meet it with an energy and compassion that does honor to its subject and will change the way we understand our world." -- Nancy Kreml, <em>Resources for Gender and Women's Studies: A Feminist Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Four O&#39;Clock Faculty: A Rogue Guide to Revolutionizing Professional Development</h2><p>Author Rich Czyz is on a mission to revolutionize professional learning for all educators.

With careful attention to detail, Michael Card embarks on an imaginative journey through the Gospel of Luke. He introduces us to Luke the historian and imagines his life as a Gentile, a doctor and a slave. Card explores Luke?s compelling account of this dynamic rabbi who astounded his hearers with parables and paradoxes. What might Luke have experienced as he interviewed eyewitnesses of Jesus?

Paul Wachtel explains why some communications in therapy are particularly effective, while others that address essentially the same content may actually be countertherapeutic. He offers clear and specific guidelines for how to ask questions and make comments in ways that facilitate collaborative exploration and promote change. Illustrated with vivid case examples, the book is grounded in an integrative theory that draws from features of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, and experiential approaches.<br><br> New to This Edition<br> * Reflects nearly 20 years of advances in the field and refinements of the author's approach.<br> *Broader audience: in addition to psychodynamic therapists, cognitive-behavioral therapists and others will find specific, user-friendly recommendations.<br> *Chapter on key developments and convergences across different psychotherapeutic approaches.<br> *Chapter on the therapeutic implications of attachment theory and research.<br><br> See also Wachtel's <i>Relational Theory and the Practice of Psychotherapy, </i>which explores a new direction in psychoanalytic thought that can expand and deepen clinical practice.</p></p><p>Paul L. Wachtel, PhD, is CUNY Distinguished Professor in the doctoral program in clinical psychology at City College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He received his doctorate in clinical psychology from Yale University and is a graduate of the postdoctoral program in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at New York University, where he is also a faculty member. Dr. Wachtel has lectured and given workshops throughout the world on psychotherapy, personality theory, and the applications of psychological theory and research to the major social issues of our time. He has been a leading voice for integrative thinking in the human sciences and was a cofounder of the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration. Dr. Wachtel is a recipient of the Hans H. Strupp Memorial Award for psychoanalytic writing, teaching, and research; the Distinguished Psychologist Award from Division 29 (Psychotherapy) of the American Psychological Association (APA); and the Scholarship and Research Award from Division 39 (Psychoanalysis) of APA.<p>"<i>Therapeutic Communication, Second Edition</i>, builds on the foundation of Wachtel's original book, but it very substantially updates and revises it, reflecting many exciting advances that have occurred in our field. Wachtel presents theoretical and clinical material that will sharpen any psychotherapist's understanding of how to communicate with patients."--Leslie S. Greenberg, PhD, Distinguished Research Professor, Department of Psychology, York University, Canada</p><p>"Paul Wachtel is among the very few teachers and theorists of psychotherapy whose writing has an immediate, direct, and powerful impact on my clinical practice. I have long used and recommended this excellent text and am delighted to see the revised second edition, which incorporates recent developments across the range of therapeutic approaches. Wachtel does not speak in generalities or abstractions; rather, he moves easily among theoretical formulations, research findings, and their practical application, illustrating his principles with numerous recognizable examples. He examines in great detail the nuances and subtleties of what you say to patients, how you say it, and the relational context within which you convey your therapeutic messages. This book is essential reading for practicing therapists of all persuasions. I can't wait to start reading it with my students."--Lewis Aron, PhD, Director, Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, New York University<br>&nbsp;<br>"The wisdom and experience of a creative therapist are reflected in every chapter. As the subtitle indicates, it's what you say and when you say it that determines what a patient hears. Novice and experienced therapists of any theoretical orientation will find this book to be of significant value. It is clear that therapy is not simply about techniques--it's about relations that work. This book shows you how and why that is true."--Robert L. Leahy, PhD, Director, American Institute for Cognitive Therapy; Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College </p><br><br>"This is the best book on how to talk to one's patients I have ever read, and it is the book I most frequently recommend to my trainees....The lessons on language embodied in this book are experience-near and clinically useful for anyone who talks with patients, regardless of theoretical orientation....Wachtel addresses with tremendous sophistication a number of thorny issues that are seldom addressed in such a clear, clinically genuine (as opposed to theoretically driven) way, such as the uses and limits of therapeutic self-disclosure and suggestion....A profound and important book." , <i>Journal of Psychotherapy Integration</i> Published On: 1996-01-03<br><br> "Quite simply, an excellent book. It is comprehensively researched; it takes an inclusive and integrative theoretical and practical approach; it engages deeply and with precision on tendentious issues and difficult concepts; and it renders explicit what a seasoned and experienced therapist may be doing intuitively....My copy is now well scribbled and earmarked, and I can imagine coming back to it again and again, not only to refine my own understanding of the difficult nettles grasped therein, but to simply begin to do all the secondary reading that Wachtel so expertly integrated into this formidable and profitable piece of work. This is a text that one would profit from greatly by reading straight through like any book; but my sense is that it will be ultimately more valuable as a reference and teaching guide.", <i>Psychodynamic Practice</i> Published On: 2011-04-13<br><br> "A comprehensive and provocative examination of the uses of language by therapists in clinical practice....Paul L. Wachtel, a noted expert, clinician, and theorist of psychotherapy...generously shares his extensive professional experience throughout the text....This book will be very helpful to clinicians in guiding their decisions about the best uses of language in clinical practice. Wachtel generously interweaves relevant theory and clinical experiences in the clearly written and informative chapters....It is up to date, comprehensive, well referenced, and strongly grounded in relevant theory and practice....Wachtel's book provides a strong impetus for examining the nature of therapeutic communication and encourages careful thought about the strategic exchange of messages to achieve therapeutic outcomes.", <i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> Published On: 2011-04-13<br><br>"Should be of significant help to students and to practitioners of psychotherapy....Nuances of communication style are treated comparatively and persuasively rather than pejoratively....Wachtel's material is fecund with an admixture of theoretical knowledge, experience, and universally applicable clinical vignettes. The chapter on achieving resolution of the patient's difficulties is particularly germane....Overall, this book would be very useful and productive in training programs for all those engaging in forms of psychotherapy." , <i>Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry</i> Published On: 1995-06-03<br><br>&#x201c;A uniquely practical guide and widely adopted text, this book shows precisely what therapists can say at key moments to enhance the process of healing and change....The book offers clear and specific guidelines for how to ask questions and make comments in ways that facilitate collaborative exploration and promote change.

The great news is that what you do <i>now </i>can make a difference in your life and the life of your future husband!<br>&nbsp;<br>Authors and good friends Robin Jones Gunn (Christy Miller series) and Tricia Goyer (author and former teen mom) believe God answers women's prayers for husbands&#x2014;even husbands they may not meet for years.

Each chapter includes helpful Bible verses, prayers, and practical application, along with true stories of women who prayed for a husband and how God answered in remarkable ways. <br>&nbsp;<br>God has a beautiful romance prepared for you.

Tricia has been married for more than twenty years and is the mother of four children.An Extraordinary Mystery<br><br>Robin:<br>Sometimes, when an idea just won&#x2019;t go away, you need to pay attention to how God is nudging you. That&#x2019;s what happened with this book.<br><br>Tricia and I have been friends for almost two decades, and both of us are writers. But our life stories as well as our love stories are radically different. Beyond writing, we do have one interesting commonality: both of us prayed for our future husbands when we were teens. But how did that add up to our writing a book together? Three incidents convinced us we should...<br><br>The first moment of inspiration fell on me with a weighty sense of urgency one bright November afternoon. I was in Brazil, standing in front of three hundred teen girls in a school cafeteria. My Christy Miller and Sierra Jensen novels for teens have been translated into Portuguese, and the teachers at this school use the books as part of their curriculum. That meant all the girls had read the books. When my husband and I entered the cafeteria, the girls greeted us with a wave of screams as if we were the real Christy and Todd all grown up and visiting them in Brazil.<br><br>To quiet down the screaming girls, I asked the translator to invite them to ask questions. One of the girls raised her hand and popped up from her seat. In Portuguese she asked me what she and her friends should do since the boys in Brazil weren&#x2019;t reading my books.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>She spoke passionately as the translator beside me explained.<br><br>&#x201c;She says that, after reading your books, she and her friends are making good decisions. They&#x2019;ve given their lives to Christ and now want to stay pure and save themselves for their future husbands. But, you see, the boys of Brazil are not reading these books. They are not making these same decisions. She wants to know what can be done about that.&#x201d;<br><br>My heart pounded. Every face in that cafeteria was fixed on me, waiting for an answer. The young woman had just identified a global problem for our present generation of Christian women. I had heard this frustration voiced many times in letters and e-mails I had received from readers over the years. But no one had ever asked me what could be done to change this dilemma of an unbalanced ratio between God-honoring young women and their male contemporaries who were slow to seek God. What could I tell her?<br><br>The words that came out of my heart were, &#x201c;You can start praying for your future husband now.&#x201d;<br><br>The translator gave her my answer, and a reverent hush fell over the room. Before me was a troop of willing but untrained young women ready to enter the warzone to fight for the young men. But how?<br><br>I wished then that I had something more to offer those girls. It&#x2019;s one thing to tell them to pray and another thing to come alongside and show them what that looks like. If only, I thought, a book existed. I wished one of my nonfiction writer friends would hurry up and write it. None of them seemed to have a passion for such a book.<br><br>The second defining moment came two years later. Tricia and I were at a writers&#x2019; retreat in California. During the afternoon break, we headed out to the pool. I settled in a lounge chair and wrote notes in my journal for a novel I was working on. Tricia succumbed to the luxurious autumn sunshine and floated off into a deep sleep.<br><br>Suddenly she woke up, turned to me, and said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; as if I&#x2019;d been talking to her while she slept.<br><br>I looked at her and spoke an unpremeditated thought. &#x201c;Tricia, we need to write a book together.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t even blink before sinking back into her afternoon lull. A moment later her head rose again. &#x201c;What are we supposed to write about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;<br><br>The gentle notion flitted past me as softly as it had fallen on Tricia. We caught the little inspiration the way an artist would reach for a floating feather or a child would bend to pick up a pale blue pebble and tuck it in a pocket.<br><br>Over the next year or so we periodically pulled the small inspiration out of our pockets and talked about what we should write. We had lots of ideas, as all creative people do. But the affirmation and direction wasn&#x2019;t there. So we waited, and we prayed...<br><br>The third moment of inspiration came with such defining clarity we knew what the book was to be about.<br><br>Tricia and I were in Montana, preparing to speak at a women&#x2019;s retreat. The night before the retreat we sneaked off to&nbsp;a lodge for some last-minute planning. I entered the lodge first while Tricia parked the car in the snow. A darling little strawberry blond toddler trotted over to me, put up his arms, and allowed me to scoop him up. His surprised young mom told me his name was Toby, he was eighteen months old, and he was usually not that friendly with strangers. Toby patted my face.<br><br>Tricia entered, and Toby&#x2019;s mother froze. She stared at Tricia and in a shaking voice said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s you! You&#x2019;re the one who spoke at the luncheon two years ago.&#x201d;<br><br>Tricia spoke often at events for teenage girls and women in Montana, so I doubted she would remember this particular young woman from a luncheon two years ago. The mom said, &#x201c;Do you remember that you talked about being a teen mom and that you prayed God would send you a Christian husband?&#x201d;<br><br>Tricia nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I did the same thing. I prayed and...&#x201d; She leaned in closer. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you remember my telling you this after the luncheon, but I had just found out I was pregnant.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<br>I remember,&#x201d; Tricia said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I was scheduled for an abortion just a few days later.&#x201d; The young woman gazed at Toby cuddled up in my arms. &#x201c;But after I heard your story and what you said about how God answered your prayers, I cancelled the appointment for the abortion, and I prayed for a husband, just like you did.&#x201d;<br><br>Her smile widened, and tears formed in her eyes as she told Tricia, &#x201c;I always wanted to see you again so I could tell you that God answered my prayers. He brought an amazing Christian guy into my life. He loves me, and he loves my son. We&#x2019;ve been married for almost a year. When I think about what my life would be like right now if I hadn&#x2019;t heard your story and did what you said...&#x201d;<br><br>By then we were all hugging and crying and hugging some more. Toby climbed into Tricia&#x2019;s arms and received her cuddles and kisses. We couldn&#x2019;t stop crying. It was such a beautiful moment. The room seemed full of light and hope.<br><br>After Toby and his mama went their way, Tricia and I sat together in stunned silence. We both knew this was it&#x2014;this<br>was the theme of the book we needed to write together: praying for your future husband. We also knew we were the two unlikely novelists being invited to pour our hearts into this project. And so we did.<br><br>As we wrote, what tumbled from our hearts surprised us. We didn&#x2019;t compose a handbook on techniques or formula for<br>effective prayer. Through the ages many wonderful such books have been written. Instead, what we saw forming, as we met together to pray and write, was a book anchored with true stories about what happens when women pray for their future husbands and the ways God answers those prayers.<br><br>Both of us agreed to tell our own stories on these pages. This took some courage. Dozens of other women gave us permission to tell portions of their stories as well&#x2014;how they prayed, how God chose to answer, and how their lives changed in the process. This took courage for them as well. We pulled from our Bibles and journals favorite scriptures and excerpts. These quotes worked perfectly to lace the chapters together.<br><br>As the book took shape, we discovered that prayer is an extraordinary mystery.<br><br>This sacred privilege of communicating with our Heavenly Father is more than a cozy, open invitation to come to Him<br>anytime, anywhere. Even though His ears are open to the cries of His children 24/7, prayer is more than that. Prayer is also an act of obedience. We are exhorted to pray for others and to pray without ceasing.<br><br>Neither Tricia nor I pretend to have prayer all figured out. What we do know is that God hears. He sees. He knows us. He cares more than we can ever comprehend. And most important of all, God answers prayer.<br><br>Perhaps you&#x2019;ve noticed that oftentimes the way God answers prayers isn&#x2019;t what we expect. We look back years later and see that what God did was oh so much better than what we first envisioned when we sent our heartfelt requests heavenward. He created us, and He desires the best for us. God always gives His best to those who leave the outcomes with Him.<br><br>Another, even more amazing mystery is that when we pray for someone else, we change. All of us were made both to give love and to receive love. When your heart connects through prayer to the One who is the source of true love, you&#x2019;ll find that praying for your future husband will wondrously result in your heart being changed. And when your heart is changed, your life is transformed.<br><br>What sort of changes will God bring about in the life of your future husband as a result of your praying for him now?<br>We don&#x2019;t know.<br><br>As you pray for him, what sort of changes will God initiate in your heart? We don&#x2019;t know that either.<br><br>But we do know there&#x2019;s only one way to find out...</p><h2>The Ghirardelli Chocolate Cookbook: Recipes and History from America&#39;s Premier Chocolate Maker</h2><p>America is experiencing a chocolate renaissance, and the epicenter is in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Ghirardelli has long been the standard-bearer for great chocolate.

Suddenly, she&#x2019;s got new friends, and a high school boy starts treating her like she&#x2019;s somebody special&#x2014;and Annabelle thinks she&#x2019;ll finally stand out in a good way. She&#x2019;ll do anything to fit in and help the team make it to the Labor Day Invitational, even if it means blowing off her old friends.

(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>**STARRED REVIEW**<br> "Morrison, a former teacher, realistically captures the challenges of middle school&#x2014;complicated family dynamics, volatile friendships, and first love&#x2014;in this story about a girl struggling to find where she belongs." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A sweet and entertaining novel that offers deeper themes to ponder." (<i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Laurie Morrison authentically captures the lovelorn daydreams as well as the awkwardness and anxiety of a middle school girl with one foot in her childhood friendships and the other venturing into the world of young adulthood . . .&nbsp;the feelings and struggles Annabelle experiences are universal and will strike a chord with middle school students." (<i>School Library Connection</i>)<br><br>"Readers will relate to Annabelle&#x2014;if not with the specifics of her life, then with the feelings of an almost teen as she navigates growing up.

(<i>Booklist</i>)</p><h2>Silent Witnesses: The Often Gruesome but Always Fascinating History of Forensic Science</h2><p><p>Crime novelist and former police officer Nigel McCrery provides an account of all the major areas of forensic science from around the world over the past two centuries. The book weaves dramatic narrative and scientific principles together in a way that allows readers to figure out crimes along with the experts. Readers are introduced to such fascinating figures as Dr. Edmond Locard, the &#x201c;French Sherlock Holmes&#x201d;; Edward Heinrich, &#x201c;Wizard of Berkeley,&#x201d; who is credited with having solved more than 2,000 crimes; and Alphonse Bertillon, the French scientist whose guiding principle, &#x201c;no two individuals share the same characteristics,&#x201d; became the core of criminal identification. Landmark crime investigations examined in depth include a notorious murder involving blood evidence and defended by F. Lee Bailey, the seminal 1936 murder that demonstrated the usefulness of the microscope in examining trace evidence, the 1849 murder of a wealthy Boston businessman that demonstrated how difficult it is to successfully dispose of a corpse, and many others.</p></p><p><p><b>Nigel McCrery</b> was a police officer before he joined the BBC in 1990. There he has worked on a number of documentaries and created various series, including the crime/forensics drama <i>Silent Witness</i>. He is the author of several crime novels, including <i>Still Waters</i>.</p><p>"It is a fascinating story and makes for a thoroughly good read." &#x2014;<i>Guardian </i><br><br></p>"A convincing and readable history of a science defined by the simple maxim: 'Every contact leaves a trace.'" &#x2014;<i>Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;For those looking for insight into the early days of forensics, this is a fascinating and informative work, a great entry point. Of special note is the chapter on DNA testing, where the author plays a role in identifying the remains of the Romanovs, the former Russian royal family.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;Where McCrery really shines is in his storytelling, which is no surprise given his background as a successful crime novelist. While certain technical portions may be difficult for some readers, true-crime enthusiasts will find the payoff worth the effort.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Silent Witnesses </i>is an easily accessible and well-written primer on the history of forensic science. It reads like a work of fiction but offers the reader a clear history of many of the most important advances in forensic investigative techniques...<i>Silent Witnesses </i>is a delightful journey through the evolution of forensic science and a very useful introduction to the subject.

For all the magic in his plays, he was writing in the grand tradition of Eugene O&#x2019;Neill and Arthur Miller, the politically engaged, direct, social realist drama. He was reclaiming ground for the theater that most people thought had been abandoned.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tony Kushner</p><p>August Wilson&#x2019;s Century Cycle is &#x201c;one of the most ambitious dramatic projects ever undertaken&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>).

Wilson&#x2019;s extraordinary lifework&#x2014;completed just before his death in October 2005&#x2014;is presented here for the first time in its entirety.</p><p> <i>Art is beholden to the kiln in which the artist was fired. Before I am anything, a man or a playwright, I am an African American. . . . The cycle of plays that I have been writing since 1979 is my attempt to represent that culture on stage in all its richness and fullness and to demonstrate its ability to sustain us in all areas of human life and endeavor and through profound moments of our history in which the larger society has thought less of us than we have thought of ourselves. </i></p><p> <i>The characters in the plays still place their faith in America&#x2019;s willingness to live up to the meaning of her creed. It is this belief in America&#x2019;s honor that allows them to pursue the American Dream even as it remains elusive. . . . They shout, they argue, they wrestle with love, honor, duty, betrayal; they have loud voices and big hearts; they demand justice, they love, they laugh, they cry, they murder, and they embrace life with zest and vigor. . . . In all the plays, the characters remain pointed towards the future, their pockets lined with fresh hope and an abiding faith in their own abilities and their own heroics.</i>&#x2014;August Wilson</p></p><p>August Wilson is the most influential and successful African American playwright writing today.

This gorgeous picture book, published by the National Geographic Society, introduces children to the constellations that are named for animals--Leo the Lion, the Great Bear and Little Bear, and many more. Christina Balit's striking paintings showcase each constellation against a deep blue background--animals or fantastical beasts positioned in the dark night sky, with the individual stars, metallic and iridescent, superimposed upon them. Each image is accompanied by a short, engaging, often dramatized description of the group of stars and the legends surrounding it, written by distinguished astronomer and writer Dr. Jacqueline Mitton: "Charging through the zodiac, here comes the Bull. Head down, horns thrust forward, Taurus is ready to toss the twins. But they are safe, always on the other side of the Milky Way." The front and endpapers are star maps that show the actual constellations of both the southern and northern skies. Mitton also offers a brief introduction to the constellations and two pages of related discussion on astronomy at the book's end. A lovely choice for anyone interested in the mysteries of the night sky. (Click to see a sample spread. Text � 1998 Jacqueline Mitton. Illustrations � 1998 Christina Balit.)

Just as we can open a fist to reveal a hand, our unbound, unconstructed being can emerge from our pain and breathe again." &#x2015;Dr. Judith Blackstone, <i>Trauma and the Unbound Body</i></p><p> Heal trauma. Reclaim your body. Live with wholeness. These are the gifts of utilizing the power of fundamental consciousness&#x2015;a subtle field of awareness that lies within each of us. In <i>Trauma and the Unbound Body</i>, Dr. Judith Blackstone explores how we can resolve the mental, physical, and emotional struggles of trauma through the power of fundamental consciousness.</p><p> Dr. Blackstone weaves her 30-plus years of psychotherapy practice to present a simple yet revolutionary approach to healing trauma. She writes, "All of the constrictions in our fascia (the connective tissue surrounding muscles and organs) are moments of our past that we have stopped in their tracks and held in that way, unconsciously. They are frozen moments of our past." <i>Trauma and the Unbound Body</i> explains how and why the body constricts in response to trauma, causing physical and emotional pain. Dr. Blackstone guides us through step-by-step processes to unwind those constrictions by attuning to fundamental consciousness, setting the body free of trauma once and for all by uncovering an unbreakable, unified ground of being.</p><p> In <i>Trauma and the Unbound Body, </i>Dr. Blackstone discusses:</p><p> ? The five main purposes for bodily constriction&#x2015;and how to release them to return to wholeness<br> ? How to inhabit the body as fundamental consciousness to liberate trauma-based constrictions<br> ? The Realization Process&#x2015;a meditative practice for embodied spiritual awakening<br> ?

No more. <em>Garden &amp; Gun</em>&#x2019;s <em>Southern Women: </em><em>More than 100 Stories of Trail Blazers, Visionaries, and Icons</em> obliterates that stereotype by sharing the stories of more than 100 of the region&#x2019;s brilliant women, groundbreakers who have by turns embraced the South&#x2019;s proud traditions and overcome its equally pervasive barriers and challenges. </p><p>Through interviews, essays, photos, and illustrations these remarkable chefs, musicians, actors, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, designers, and public servants will offer a dynamic portrait of who the Southern woman is now. The voices of bona fide icons such as Sissy Spacek, Leah Chase, and Loretta Lynn join those whose stories for too long have been overlooked or underestimated, from the pioneering Texas rancher Minnie Lou Bradley to the Gee&#x2019;s Bend, Alabama, quilter Mary Margaret Pettway&#x2014;all visionaries who have left their indelible mark not just on Southern culture, but on America itself. </p><p>By reading these stories of triumph, grit, and grace, the ties that bind the sisterhood of Southern women emerge: an unflinching resilience and resourcefulness, an inherent love of the land, a singular style and wit. And while the wisdom shared may be rooted in the Southern experience, the universal themes are sure to resonate beyond the Mason-Dixon.</p></p><p><p><em>Garden &amp; Gun</em> is a national magazine that covers the best of the South, including its sporting culture, food, music, art, and literature, and its people and their ideas. The magazine has won numerous awards for journalism, design, and overall excellence, and its two previous books, <em>The Southerner's Handbook</em> and <em>Good Dog</em>, were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers.</p></p><h2>Sacra Pagina: The Gospel of Luke (Volume 3)</h2><p><p>What makes this commentary on Luke stand apart from others is that, from beginning to end, this is a literary analysis.

I had attended the Catholic elementary school in New Iberia with three of them, had served with one of them in Vietnam, and for a short time had dated Drew, the youngest child, before I went away to the war. But, as I learned with Drew, the Sonniers belonged to that group of people whom you like from afar, not because of what they are themselves, but because of what they represent&#x2014;a failure in the way that they&#x2019;re put together, a collapse of some genetic or familial element that should be the glue of humanity.<br> <br>The background of the Sonnier children was one that you instinctively knew you didn&#x2019;t want to know more about, in the same way that you don&#x2019;t want to hear the story of a desperate and driven soul in an after-hours bar. As a police officer it has been my experience that pedophiles are able to operate and stay functional over long periods of time and victimize scores, even hundreds, of children, because no one wants to believe his or her own intuitions about the symptoms in the perpetrator. We are repelled and sickened by the images that our own minds suggest, and we hope against hope that the problem is in reality simply one of misperception.<br> <br>Systematic physical cruelty toward children belongs in the same shoebox. Nobody wants to deal with it. I cannot remember one occasion, in my entire life, when I saw one adult interfere in a public place with the mistreatment of a child at the hands of another adult. Prosecutors often wince when they have to take a child abuser to trial, because usually the only witnesses they can use are children who are terrified at the prospect of testifying against their parents. And ironically a successful prosecution means that the victim will become a legal orphan, to be raised by foster parents or in a state institution that is little more than a warehouse for human beings.<br> <br>As a child I saw the cigarette burns on the arms and legs of the Sonnier children. They were scabbed over and looked like coiled, gray worms. I came to believe that the Sonniers grew up in a furnace rather than a home.<br> <br>It was a lovely spring day when the dispatcher at the Iberia Parish sheriff&#x2019;s office, where I worked as a plainclothes detective, called me at home and said that somebody had fired a gun through Weldon Sonnier&#x2019;s dining-room window and I could save time by going out there directly rather than reporting to the office first.<br> <br>I was at my breakfast table, and through the open window I could smell the damp, fecund odor of the hydrangeas in my flower bed and last night&#x2019;s rainwater dripping out of the pecan and oak trees in the yard. It was truly a fine morning, the early sunlight as soft as smoke in the tree limbs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you there, Dave?&#x201d; the dispatcher said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ask the sheriff to send someone else on this one,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like Weldon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like Weldon. I just don&#x2019;t like some of the things that probably go on in Weldon&#x2019;s head.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll tell the old man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll head out there in about fifteen minutes. Give me the rest of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all we got. His wife called it in. He didn&#x2019;t. Does that sound like Weldon?&#x201d; He laughed.<br> <br>People said Weldon had spent over two hundred thousand dollars restoring his antebellum home out in the parish on Bayou Teche. It was built of weathered white-painted brick, with a wide columned porch, a second-floor verandah that wrapped all the way around the house, ventilated green window shutters, twin brick chimneys at each extreme of the house, and scrolled ironwork that had been taken from historical buildings in the New Orleans French Quarter. The long driveway that led from the road to the house was covered with a canopy of moss-hung live oaks, but Weldon Sonnier was not one to waste land space for the baroque and ornamental. All the property in front of the house, even the area down by the bayou where the slave quarters had once stood, had been leased to tenants who planted sugarcane on it.<br> <br>It had always struck me as ironic that Weldon would pay out so much of his oil money in order to live in an antebellum home, whereas in fact he had grown up in an Acadian farmhouse that was over one hundred and fifty years old, a beautiful piece of hand-hewn, notched, and pegged cypress architecture that members of the New Iberia historical preservation society openly wept over when Weldon hired a group of half-drunk black men out of a ramshackle, backroad nightclub, gave them crowbars and axes, and calmly smoked a cigar and sipped from a glass of Cold Duck on top of a fence rail while they ripped the old Sonnier house into a pile of boards he later sold for two hundred dollars to a cabinetmaker.<br> <br>When I drove my pickup truck down the driveway and parked under a spreading oak by the front porch, two uniformed deputies were waiting for me in their car, their front doors open to let in the breeze that blew across the shaded lawn. The driver, an ex-Houston cop named Garrett, a barrel of a man with a thick blond mustache and a face the color of a fresh sunburn, flipped his cigarette into the rose bed and stood up to meet me. He wore pilot&#x2019;s sunglasses, and a green dragon was tattooed around his right forearm. He was still new, and I didn&#x2019;t know him well, but I&#x2019;d heard that he had resigned from the Houston force after he had been suspended during an Internal Affairs investigation.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you have?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not much,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Mr. Sonnier says it was probably an accident. Some kids hunting rabbits or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does Mrs. Sonnier say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s eating tranquilizers in the breakfast room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does she say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing, detective.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Call me Dave. You think it was just some kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take a look at the size of the hole in the dining room wall and tell me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then I saw him bite the corner of his lip at the abruptness in his tone. I started toward the front door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dave, wait a minute,&#x201d; he said, took off his glasses, and pinched the bridge of his nose. &#x201c;While you were on vacation, the woman called us twice and reported a prowler. We came out and didn&#x2019;t find anything, so I marked it off. I thought maybe her terminals were a little fried.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They are. She&#x2019;s a pill addict.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She said she saw a guy with a scarred face looking through her window. She said it looked like red putty or something. The ground was wet, though, and I didn&#x2019;t see any footprints. But maybe she did see something. I probably should have checked it out a little better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. I&#x2019;ll take it from here. Why don&#x2019;t you guys head up to the caf� for coffee?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the sister of that Nazi or Klan politician in New Orleans, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got it. Weldon knows how to pick &#x2019;em.&#x201d; Then I couldn&#x2019;t resist. &#x201c;You know who Weldon&#x2019;s brother is, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lyle Sonnier.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That TV preacher in Baton Rouge? No kidding? I bet that guy could steal the stink off of shit and not get the smell on his hands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to south Louisiana, podna.&#x201d;<br> <br>Weldon shook hands when he answered the door. His hand was big, square, callused along the heel and the index finger. Even when he grinned, Weldon&#x2019;s face was bold, the eyes like buckshot, the jaw rectangular and hard. His brown-gray crewcut was shaved to the scalp above his large ears, and he always seemed to be biting softly on his molars, flexing the lumps of cartilage behind his jawline. He wore his house slippers, a pair of faded beltless Levi&#x2019;s, and a paint-stained T-shirt that molded his powerful biceps and flat stomach. He hadn&#x2019;t shaved and he had a cup of coffee in his hand. He was polite to me&#x2014;Weldon was always polite&#x2014;but he kept looking at his watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you anything else, Dave,&#x201d; he said, as we stood in the doorway of his dining room. &#x201c;I was standing there in front of the glass doors, looking out at the sunrise over the bayou, and pop, it came right through the glass and hit the wall over yonder.&#x201d; He grinned.<br> <br>&#x201c;It must have scared you,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you look all shaken up, Weldon. Why did your wife call us instead of you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She worries a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, Dave, I saw two black kids earlier. They chased a rabbit out of the canebrake, then I saw them shooting at some mockingbirds up in a tree on the bayou. I think they live in one of those old nigger shacks down the road. Why don&#x2019;t you go talk to them?&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at the time on the mahogany grandfather clock at the far end of the dining room, then adjusted the hands on his wristwatch.<br> <br>&#x201c;The black kids didn&#x2019;t have a shotgun, did they?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did they have a .22?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Dave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;d probably have if they were shooting rabbits or mockingbirds, wouldn&#x2019;t they? At least if they didn&#x2019;t have a shotgun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at the hole in the pane of glass toward the top of the French door. I pulled my fountain pen, one almost as thick as my little finger, from my pocket and inserted the end in the hole. Then I crossed the dining room and did the same thing with the hole in the wall. There was a stud behind the wall, and the fountain pen went into the hole three inches before it tapped anything solid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you believe a .22 round did this?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it ricocheted and toppled,&#x201d; he answered.<br> <br>I walked back to the French doors, opened them onto the flagstone patio, and gazed down the sloping blue-green lawn to the bayou. Among the cypresses and oaks on the bank were a dock and a weathered boat shed. Between the mudbank and the lawn was a low red-brick wall that Weldon had constructed to keep his land from eroding into the Teche.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think what you&#x2019;re doing is dumb, Weldon,&#x201d; I said, still looking at the brick wall and the trees on the bank silhouetted against the glaze of sunlight on the bayou&#x2019;s brown surface.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who has reason to hurt you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a soul.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;At least not to my knowledge.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be personal, but your brother-in-law is Bobby Earl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s quite a guy. A CBS newsman called him &#x2018;the Robert Redford of racism.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, Bobby liked that one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard you pulled Bobby across a table in Copeland&#x2019;s by his necktie and sawed it off with a steak knife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, it was Mason&#x2019;s over on Magazine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I see. How did he like being humiliated in a restaurant full of people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He took it all right. Bobby&#x2019;s not a bad guy. You just have to define the situation for him once in a while.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about some of his followers&#x2014;Klansmen, American Nazis, members of the Aryan Nation? You think they&#x2019;re all-right guys, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t take Bobby seriously.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A lot of people do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s their problem. Bobby has about six inches of dong and two of brain. If the press left him alone, he&#x2019;d be selling debit insurance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard another story about you, Weldon, maybe a more serious one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dave, I don&#x2019;t want to offend you. I&#x2019;m sorry you had to come out here. I&#x2019;m sorry my wife is wired all the time and sees rubber faces leering in the window. I appreciate the job you have to do, but I don&#x2019;t know who put a hole in my glass. That&#x2019;s the truth, and I have to go to work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard you&#x2019;re broke.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What else is new? That&#x2019;s the independent oil business. It&#x2019;s either dusters or gushers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you owe somebody money?&#x201d;<br> <br>I saw the cartilage work behind his jaws.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting a little on edge here, Dave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I drilled my first well with spit and junkyard scrap. I didn&#x2019;t get a goddamn bit of help from anybody either. No loans, no credit, just me, four nigras, an alcoholic driller from Texas, and a lot of ass-busting work.&#x201d; He pointed his finger at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve kept it together for twenty years, too, podna. I don&#x2019;t go begging money from anybody, and I&#x2019;ll tell you something else, too. Somebody leans on me, somebody fires a rifle into my house, I square it personally.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d hate to see you in trouble, Weldon. I&#x2019;d like to talk with your wife now, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>He put a cigarette in his mouth, lit it, and dropped the heavy metal lighter indifferently on the gleaming wood surface of his dining-room table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just take it a little bit easy. She&#x2019;s having a reaction to her medication or something. It affects her blood pressure.&#x201d;<br> <br>His wife was a pale, small-boned, ash-blonde woman, whose milk-white skin was lined with blue veins. She wore a pink silk house robe, and she had brushed her hair back over her neck and had put on fresh makeup. She should have been pretty, but she always had a startled look in her blue eyes, as though she heard invisible doors slamming around her. The breakfast room was domed and glassed-in, filled with sunlight and hanging fern and philodendron plants, and the view of the bayou, the oaks and the bamboo, the trellises erupting with purple wisteria, was a magnificent one. But her face seemed to register none of it. Her eyes were unnaturally wide, the pupils shrunken to small black dots, her skin so tight that you thought perhaps someone was twisting the back of her hair in a knot. I wondered what it must have been like to grow up in the same home that had produced a man like Bobby Earl.<br> <br>She had been christened Bama. Her accent was soft, pleasant to listen to, more Mississippi than Louisiana, but in it you heard a tremolo, as though a nerve ending were pulled loose and fluttering inside her.<br> <br>She said she had been in bed when she heard the shot and the glass break. But she hadn&#x2019;t seen anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about this prowler you reported, Mrs. Sonnier? Do you have any idea who he might have been?&#x201d; I smiled at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You never saw him before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. He was horrible.&#x201d;<br> <br>I saw Weldon raise his eyes toward the ceiling, then turn away and look out at the bayou.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you mean?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;He must have been in a fire,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;His ears were little stubs. His face was like red rubber, like a big red inner-tube patch.&#x201d;<br> <br>Weldon turned back toward me.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got all that on file down at your office, haven&#x2019;t you, Dave?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not any point in covering the same old territory, is there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe not, Weldon,&#x201d; I said, closed my small notebook, and replaced it in my pocket. &#x201c;Mrs. Sonnier, here&#x2019;s one of my cards. Give me a call if you remember anything else or if I can be of any other help to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Weldon rubbed one hand on the back of the other and tried to hold the frown out of his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a walk down to the back of your property, if you don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Help yourself,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The Saint Augustine grass was wet with the morning dew and thick as a sponge as I walked between the oaks down to the bayou. In a sunny patch of ground next to an old gray roofless barn, one that still had an ancient tin Hadacol sign nailed to a wall, was a garden planted with strawberries and watermelons. I walked along beside the brick retaining wall, scanning the mudflat that sloped down to the bayou&#x2019;s edge. It was crisscrossed with the tracks of neutrias and raccoons and the de...</p><h2>Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies, 4th Edition</h2><p><b>There's nothing random about it&#x2014;this is <i>the</i> book on statistical analysis with Excel</b> <p>Stunned by statistics?

Here is a refreshing and meaningful guide to the spiritual core we, as a society, always seem to be seeking.</p><p>Nationally acclaimed speaker and memoir writer Clifton Taulbert presents eight habits that build the essence of social stability. His habits, which are broken down into brief chapters--"A Nurturing Attitude," "Dependability," "Responsibility," "Friendship," "Brotherhood," "High Expectations," "Courage," and "Hope"--may not be stunningly original, yet they reflect a kind of plainspoken "front-porch wisdom" rooted in Taulbert's Southern upbringing. His elders ignored the boundaries of legal segregation and embarked on a campaign to offer a community that embraced the dreams and successes of each child and family. This is an excellent book for young-adult readers who will appreciate the rich, memoir-style storytelling and the simple but genuine lessons of how to be a good person in order to build a more spiritually evolved world. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Clifton Taulbert is the author of three memoirs: <b>Once Upon A Time When We Were Colored</b>, the basis for the critically acclaimed feature film by the same name; <b>The Last Train North, Watching Our Crops Come In</b>, and most recently, <b>Little Cliff and the Porch People</b>.

In this gorgeous sequel to <i>Slim Aarons-Once Upon a Time</i>, he develops the environmental portrait to the level of art, always showing his subjects in their natural setting, in a circumstance synonymous with their station in life. He documented a particular world that is vanished. <i>A Place in the Sun</i> is that special glimpse of privilege under a bright and beaming sky, whether on sandy shore, snowy slope, or elegant home where cares are few. Through 250 stunning color pictures, Aarons provides a veritable who's who of high society: Aristotle Onassis with his first wife, Tina, and their children, Christina and Alexander; C.Z. Guest at her villa in Palm Beach; the Aga Khan at his Sardinian resort; and Truman Capote in Palm Springs. From Mustique to Monaco, from Aspen to Gstaad, only Slim Aarons can take us on a journey to the most exclusive playgrounds of the rich, inspiring even the most jaded armchair traveler.</p><p>Slim Aarons is one of the most influential magazine photographers of his generation. Born and raised in New Hampshire, he served as a World War II combat photographer for <i>Yank</i> magazine in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. He freelanced from Rome, then Hollywood, and finally New York. His photographs appeared in many magazines, including <i>Holiday, Town &amp; Country, Life, Look, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue</i>, and <i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i>. His first book, <i>A Wonderful Time</i> (1974), is considered a photography classic. He lives in Bedford, New York.<i>Starred Review.</i> Flipping through the azure, emerald and sun-kissed pages of "golden age" celebrity photographer Aarons's third collection of images, it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia, even if a backyard wading pool is as close as one ever got to the Cap d'Antibes. For as devotedly as Aarons documented the glamorous lives of the now all-but-vanished jet set&#x2014;for magazines like <i>Life</i>, <i>Holiday</i> and <i>Town and Country</i> in the '50s, '60s and '70s&#x2014;he was also witness to a time when the relationship between the "Beautiful People" and the rest of us was mostly one of uncomplicated envy and admiration. Oh, sure, some bitter Trotskyist might have objected to the godlike image of a nonchalant Kirk Douglas water-skiing with his hands on his hips, but many people were happy to gaze upon these photos of dewy poolside heiresses and arcadian Rolls-Royce desert picnics. Aarons himself had been through WWII; is it any wonder, then, that when asked to cover Korea, he replied that "the only beach [he] was interested in landing on was one decorated with beautiful seminude girls tanning in a tranquil sun"? In an age when celebrities have increasingly become the objects of ridicule and disgust, of "inside" gossip and intrusive speculation, Aarons's lushly appointed and tenderly chronicled world looks more attractive than ever. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lyndon B. Johnson's flawed personality and character traits, formed as a child, grew unchecked for the rest of his life as he suffered severe bouts of manic-depressive illness. He successfully hid this disorder from the public as he bartered, stole, and finessed his way through the corridors of power on Capitol Hill, though it's recorded that some of his aides knew of his struggle with bipolar disorder.<br><br>After years of researching Johnson and the JFK assassination, Phillip F. Nelson conclusively shows that LBJ had an active role in JFK's assassination, and he includes newly-uncovered photographic evidence proving that Johnson knew when and where Kennedy's assassination would take place. Nelson's careful and meticulous research has led him to uncover secrets from one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in our country's history.</p><p>I remember reading the Life magazine articles on the weekend of the assassination, about Lyndon Johnson's connections with Bobby Baker, and the latter's extensive involvement with a number of shady characters.&nbsp; And I began wondering about just who this guy was.&nbsp; The more I read, the more I came to distrust this fellow who liked to portray himself as a glad-handing, back-slapping, "regular guy."&nbsp;&nbsp; And I came to find out he was anything but those caricatures. <br> &nbsp;<br> As a result of the failure of the "Fourth Estate" to perform their constitutional function, Lyndon Johnson is now ranked generally #9-12 in the various rankings of "greatest presidents" by academics and historians.&nbsp; There are a number of contemporary books by his biographers and "historians" (a misnomer, as it applies to those who have avoided the truth about Johnson) who laud him for his wonderful efforts in the area of Civil Rights, but many of them ignore the facts that:<br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson was in fact very racist in his views of black Americans and latinos;<br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1964 Civil Rights Act is the same legislation that Johnson had suppressed while he was vice president and chairman of the EEO Committee under JFK.<br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The act was passed on the back of JFK and Johnson had kept it stalled until he became president, then immediately pushed Congress to adopt it.<br><br> These, and many other truths about Lyndon Johnson are revealed in my book, "LBJ: The Mastermind of JFK's Assassination."<br>We identify numerous cases where the "benefit of the doubt" was given to Lyndon Johnson throughout his life.&nbsp; We start by looking back into Johnson's past, from the time he was a boy in Texas.&nbsp; We follow the development of his character traits throughout his school days, through college and as a young congressional apprentice in Washington. <br><br>The essential themes of the book relate to how Johnson's mental issues and criminal associations drove him to commit more brazen criminal acts, including, according to specific named sources, the ordering of multiple murders of people who "got in his way."&nbsp; Ultimately, the ever increasing stakes and his increasingly heinous criminal acts steeled his resolve to enlist the help of other key military and intelligence men to effect Johnson's "Executive Action" plan to assassinate John F. Kennedy.<br> <br>There are many loose strings which connect all of this together and reveal the existence of a widely based conspiracy, with connections to the military and CIA networks, even though nothing was ever written by the plotters to allow direct tracing to their organizations.&nbsp; But there are many other traces which have become known over time: &nbsp;<br> <br><b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b>Lyndon B. Johnson's flawed personality and character traits were formed when he was a child, and - through his primary enablers, his mother and his wife - grew unchecked for the rest of his life as he suffered severe bouts of manic-depressive illness.&nbsp; The people-manipulation skills he learned at his father's side and had perfected by the time he graduated from college became the currency he used to barter, steal and finesse his way through the corridors of power on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; These skills, combined with his overpowering manic personality, amoral instincts and thirst for power, allowed him to prosper both financially and politically during his years in Congress. Neither his family nor his employees, aides, associates and cabinet officials would ever confront him on any issue for which he had made up his mind, including the Vietnam War.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, his "darker side" included a lifetime struggle with "bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder" which he successfully hid from the public, though not all of his aides. It is the premise of this book that Lyndon Johnson suffered recurrent and progressively stronger bouts of mental collapses during the period of his vice presidency as he planned his ascension to the presidency, purposely undermining Kennedy's domestic and foreign policy initiatives for the purpose of cleverly saving them for his own legacy. His active involvement with JFK's assassination will be conclusively shown, including photographic evidence that he knew in advance when and where it would happen. The stunning conclusion of this book is that Lyndon Johnson began planning his takeover - the fulfillment of his life-time dreams - even before being named as the vice presidential nominee in 1960.</p><h2>Wintercake: A Winter and Holiday Book for Kids</h2><p><p><strong>This cozy, gently humorous, and irresistible holiday tale from Newbery Medalist and <em>New York Times</em>-bestselling author Lynne Rae Perkins features universal themes of friendship, community, empathy, and&nbsp;generosity. <em>Wintercake </em>is a great pick for story times during the winter season.</strong> </p><p>When&nbsp;Thomas misplaces the basket of dried fruit he needs to make his seasonal wintercake, friends old and new come together to save the day.&nbsp;Newbery Medalist and acclaimed picture book creator Lynne Rae Perkins weaves a delightful holiday tale full of surprises and gentle humor.</p><p><em>Wintercake</em>&nbsp;is a book about holiday traditions and why they matter.

The original work, comprised of five volumes, was written by Alfred Edersheim and was first published in or about 1883. This vast work builds on a foundation of historical, sociological, philosophical and theological references, and has as one of its primary aims to set the Gospels of the New Testament in chronological order. As each of the Gospels has its unique presentation of the story of Christ, Edersheim&#39;s chronological presentation and commentary reveals important threads and story lines that are not immediately obvious with their reading in the usual order. This abridgment follows Edersheim&#39;s chronological set out, retains the high points of his commentary and includes the passages of the Gospels immediately below his commentary for easy reference. Also included in this abridgment are rudimentary maps tracing the movements of Christ as well as pictures from Galilee, Nazareth and Jerusalem, some photos being well over 100 years old, preserving images of important New Testament sites in a setting far more like the time of Christ then can be seen in modern developed Israel. Edersheim&#39;s original work is reduced by about 90% in this abridgment providing a chronological framework for reading the four Gospels side by side and simultaneously, within the highpoints of his commentary. It is an excellent experience for beginning bible readers, a good introduction to intermediate students wanting to work their way up to a study of the full five volumes, and a quick reference or companion tool for those who are studying the work in its entirety.</p><p></p><h2>Love Worth Giving: Living in the Overflow of God&#39;s Love</h2><p><p>Low on Love?</p><p>Finding it hard to love?

He seeks. We bring sin. He brings a sacrifice. We try fig leaves. He brings the robe of righteousness. And we are left to sing the song of the prophet: "He has covered me with clothes of salvation and wrapped me with a coat of goodness, like a bridegroom dressed for his wedding like a bride dressed in jewels" (Isa. 61:10).</p> <p>In the 1930s, Joe Wise was a young, single resident at Cook Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. Patients called him the "doctor with the rose." He made them smile by pinning a flower from bedside bouquets on his lab coat.</p> <p>Madge, however, needed more than a smile. The automobile accident had left her leg nearly severed at the knee. She was young, beautiful, and very much afraid. When Joe spotted her in the ER, he did something he'd never done before.</p> <p>Joe took his lab coat, bejeweled with the rose, and placed it gently over the young woman. As she was wheeled into the operating room, the coat was removed, but she asked to keep the flower. When she awoke from surgery, it was still in her hand. </p> <p>When I tell you that Madge never forgot Joe, you won't be surprised. When I tell you how she thanked him, you very well may be.</p> <p>But before we finish the story of Joe's cloak, could I ask you to think about your own? Do you own a cloak of love? Do you know anyone who needs one? When you cover someone with concern, you are fulfilling what Paul had in mind when he wrote the phrase "love . . . always protects" (1 Cor. 13:4-7 niv). </p> <p>Paul employed a rich word here. Its root meaning is "to cover or conceal." Its cousins on the noun side of the family are <i>roof</i> and <i>shelter.</i> When Paul said, "Love always protects," he might have been thinking of the shade of a tree or the refuge of a house. He might even have been thinking of a coat. One scholar thinks he was. The <i>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</i> is known for its word study, not its poetry. But the scholar sounds poetic as he explains the meaning of <i>protect</i> as used in 1 Corinthians 13:7. The word conveys, he says, "the idea of covering with a cloak of love."1</p> <p>Remember receiving one? You were nervous about the test, but the teacher stayed late to help you. You were far from home and afraid, but your mother phoned to comfort you. You were innocent and accused, so your friend stood to defend you. Covered with encouragement. Covered with tender-hearted care. Covered with protection. <i>Covered with a cloak of love.</i></p> <p>Your finest cloak of love, however, came from God. Never thought of your Creator as a clothier? Adam and Eve did. </p> <p>Every clothing store in the world owes its existence to Adam and Eve. Ironing boards, closets, hangers-all trace their ancestry back to the Garden of Eden. Before Adam and Eve sinned, they needed no clothing; after they sinned, they couldn't get dressed fast enough. They hid in the bushes and set about the task of making a wardrobe out of fig leaves.</p> <p>They craved protection. Well they should have. They knew the consequences of their mistake. God had warned them, "You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not even touch it, or you will die" (Gen. 3:3). </p> <p>Of course the one tree they were told not to touch was the one they couldn't resist, and the fruit of the tree became a doorknob that, once pulled, permitted a slew of unwanted consequences to enter. </p> <p>One of which was shame. Adam and Eve had felt no shame. Then they felt nothing but. Hence they hid, and hence they sewed, but the covering was insufficient. What is a grove of trees to the eyes of God? What protection is found in a fig leaf? </p> <p>Adam and Eve found themselves, like Madge, vulnerable on a gurney-wounded, not by a car, but by their own sin.</p> <p>But what would God do? Had he not announced his judgment? Hadn't his law been broken? Didn't justice demand their death? Is he not righteous?</p> <p>But, we are quick to counter, is God not love? And weren't Adam and Eve his children? Could his mercy override his justice? Is there some way that righteousness can coexist with kindness? </p> <p>According to Genesis 3:21 it can. The verse has been called the first gospel sermon. Preached not by preachers, but by God himself. Not with words, but with symbol and action. You want to see how God responds to our sin? </p> <p>"The Lord God made clothes from animal skins for the man and his wife and dressed them" (Gen. 3:21). </p> <p>The mystery behind those words! Read them again, and try to envision the moment. </p> <p>"The Lord God made clothes from animal skins for the man and his wife and dressed them." </p> <p>That simple sentence suggests three powerful scenes. </p> <p>Scene 1: God slays an animal. For the first time in the history of the earth, dirt is stained with blood. Innocent blood. The beast committed no sin. The creature did not deserve to die. </p> <p>Adam and Eve did. The couple deserve to die, but they live. The animal deserves to live, but it dies. In scene 1, innocent blood is shed.</p> <p>Scene 2: Clothing is made. The shaper of the stars now becomes a tailor. </p> <p>And in Scene 3: God dresses them. "The Lord . . . dressed them."</p> <p>Oh, for a glimpse of that moment. Adam and Eve are on their way out of the garden. They've been told to leave, but now God tells them to stop. "Those fig leaves," he says, shaking his head, "will never do." And he produces some clothing. But he doesn't throw the garments at their feet and tell them to get dressed. He dresses them himself. "Hold still, Adam. Let's see how this fits." As a mother would dress a toddler. As a father would zip up the jacket of a preschooler. As a physician would place a lab coat over a frightened girl. God covers them. He protects them.</p> <p>Love always protects. </p> <p>Hasn't he done the same for us? We eat our share of forbidden fruit. We say what we shouldn't say. Go where we shouldn't go. Pluck fruit from trees we shouldn't touch.</p> <p>And when we do, the door opens, and the shame tumbles in. And we hide. We sew fig leaves. Flimsy excuses. See-through justifications. We cover ourselves in good works and good deeds, but one gust of the wind of truth, and we are naked again-stark naked in our own failure. </p> <p>So what does God do? Exactly what he did for our parents in the garden. He sheds innocent blood. He offers the life of his Son. And from the scene of the sacrifice the Father takes a robe-not the skin of an animal-but the robe of righteousness. And does he throw it in our direction and tell us to shape up? No, he dresses us himself. He dresses us <i>with</i> himself. "You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ" (Gal. 3:26-27). </p> <p>The robing is his work, not ours. Did you note the inactivity of Adam and Eve? They did nothing. Absolutely nothing. They didn't request the sacrifice; they didn't think of the sacrifice; they didn't even dress themselves. They were passive in the process. So are we. "You have been saved by grace through believing. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. It was not the result of your own efforts, so you cannot brag about it. God has made us what we are" (Eph. 2:8-10).</p> <p>We hide. He seeks. We bring sin. He brings a sacrifice. We try fig leaves. He brings the robe of righteousness. And we are left to sing the song of the prophet: "He has covered me with clothes of salvation and wrapped me with a coat of goodness, like a bridegroom dressed for his wedding, like a bride dressed in jewels" (Isa. 61:10). </p> <p>God has clothed us. He protects us with a cloak of love. Can you look back over your life and see instances of God's protection? I can too. My junior year in college I was fascinated by a movement of Christians several thousand miles from my campus. Some of my friends decided to spend the summer at the movement's largest church and be discipled. When I tried to do the same, every door closed. Problem after problem with finances, logistics, and travel.</p> <p>A second opportunity surfaced: spending a summer in Brazil. In this case, every door I knocked on swung open. Two and one half decades later I see how God protected me. The movement has become a cult-dangerous and oppressive. Time in Brazil introduced me to grace-freeing and joyful. Did God protect me? Does God protect us? </p> <p>Does he do for us what he did for the woman caught in adultery? He protected her from the stones. And his disciples? He protected them from the storm. And the demoniac? He protected him from hell itself. Why, Jesus even protected Peter from the tax collectors by providing a tax payment.</p> <p>And you? Did he keep you from a bad relationship? Protect you from the wrong job? Insulate you from _______________ (you fill in the blank)? "Like hovering birds, so will [the Lord Almighty] protect Jerusalem" (Isa. 31:5 jb). "He will strengthen and protect you" (2 Thess. 3:3 niv). "He will command his angels . . . to guard you" (Ps. 91:11 niv). God protects you with a cloak of love.</p> <p>Wouldn't you love to do the same for him? What if you were given the privilege of Mary? What if God himself were placed in your arms as a naked baby? Would you not do what she did? "She wrapped the baby with pieces of cloth" (Luke 2:7).</p> <p>The baby Jesus, still wet from the womb, was cold and chilled. So this mother did what any mother would do; she did what love does: She covered him. </p> <p>Three decades later another lover of Christ did the same. This time the body of Jesus wasn't cold from the chill; it was cold from death. Joseph of Arimathea had it lowered from the cross. Just as Mary cleansed the child from the womb, Joseph prepared the Savior for the tomb. He washed the spit from the face and sponged the blood from the beard. "Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth" (Matt. 27:59). </p> <p>Mary dressed the baby. Joseph cleansed the body.</p> <p>Wouldn't you cherish an opportunity to do the same? You have one. Such opportunities come your way every day. Jesus said, </p> <p>I was without clothes, and you gave me something to wear." . . .</p> <p>When," [the people asked,] "did we see you without clothes and give you something to wear?" . . . </p> <p>I tell you the truth, anything you did for even the least of my people here, you also did for me." (Matt. 25:36, 38, 40) </p> <p>Do you know anyone, like Madge, who is wounded and afraid? Do you know anyone, like Adam and Eve, who is guilty and embarrassed? Do you know anyone who needs a cloak of love? </p> <p>Have you ever had a teenager in trouble? You hear the garage door open after the curfew hour. You climb out of bed and march to the kitchen, and there you find him at the counter. The smell of beer is on his breath. The flush of alcohol is on his cheeks. This is serious. He has been drinking. He has been driving. You have a problem, and I have a question. What are you going to give your son?</p> <p>Are you going to give him a lecture? He deserves one. Are you going to give him three months with no keys? That may be wise. Are you going to give him a life sentence with no parole? That may be understandable, considering your worry-but don't forget to give your child a cloak of love. At some point over the next few hours he desperately needs to feel your arm around his shoulders. He needs to be cloaked, covered, blanketed in your love. Love always protects. </p> <p>Know anyone who needs a cloak of love?</p> <p>Have you ever heard anyone gossip about someone you know? Ever seen human jackals make a meal out of a fallen friend? "Well, I heard that she . . ." "Oh, but didn't you know that she . . ." "Let me tell you what a friend told me about him . . ." Then all of a sudden it's your turn. Everybody is picking your friend apart. What do you have to say?</p> <p>Here is what love says: Love says nothing. Love stays silent. "Love covers a multitude of sins" (1 Pet. 4:8 nasb). Love doesn't expose. It doesn't gossip. If love says anything, love speaks words of defense. Words of kindness. Words of protection. </p> <p>Know anyone in need of a cloak of love? </p> <p>A few years back I offered one to my daughters. The whirlwind of adolescence was making regular runs through our house, bringing with it more than our share of doubts, pimples, and peer pressure. I couldn't protect the girls from the winds, but I could give them an anchor to hold in the midst. On Valentine's Day, 1997, I wrote the following and had it framed for each daughter: </p> <p>I have a special gift for you. My gift is warmth at night and sunlit afternoons, chuckles and giggles and happy Saturdays.</p> <p>But how do I give this gift? Is there a store which sells laughter? A catalog that offers kisses? No. Such a treasure can't be bought. But it can be given. And here is how I give it to you. </p> <p>Your Valentine's Day gift is a promise, a promise that I will always love your mother. With God as my helper, I will never leave her. You'll never come home to find me gone. You'll never wake up and find that I have run away. You'll always have two parents. I will love your mother. I will honor your mother. I will cherish your mother. That is my promise. That is my gift.</p> <p>Love, Dad</p> <p>Know anyone who could use some protection? Of course you do. Then give some.</p> <p>Pay a gas bill for a struggling elderly couple.</p> <p>Promise your kids that, God being your helper, they'll never know a hungry day or a homeless night. </p> <p>Tell your husband that you'd do it all over again and invite him on a honeymoon. </p> <p>Make sure your divorced friends are invited to your parties. </p> <p>And when you see a wounded soul, shivering and shaken on a gurney of life, offer a lab coat and leave the rose.</p> <p>That's what Dr. Wise did. And he didn't stop there. As Madge recovered, he paid visits to her room. Many visits. When he learned that she was engaged, he hung a "No Visitors" sign on her door so her fianc� couldn't enter. Madge didn't object. Her diary reads, "I hope that handsome young doctor comes by to visit today." He did, that day and many others, always with a rose. One a day until she was dismissed from the hospital. </p> <p>And Madge never forgot. Her response? She gave him a rose in return. The next day she gave another. Then the next, another. As they started dating, the daily roses still came. When they married, she didn't stop giving them. Madge convinced the Colonial Golf Course across the street from her house to plant roses so she could give the doctor his daily gift. For nearly forty years, every day-a rose. Their younger son, Harold, says he can't remember a time when there wasn't a glass in the refrigerator containing roses for his dad.3 </p> <p>A cloak of love. A rose of gratitude. </p> <p>Have you been given the first? Then take time to give the second<b>. </b></p></p><h2>My Crocheted Closet: 22 Styles for Every Day of the Week</h2><p>Showcase your crochet style every day of the week, every month of the year!

Prayer.</b><br>Stop tiptoeing around in fear of offending God. With him, there are no secrets. Animate your prayers with the depth and honesty of your whole heart&#x2015;from joy and awe to shame, fear, and even inconsolable rage.<br><br><i>The Message of Psalms</i> will show you how. Eugene Peterson&#x2019;s fresh rendering of this ancient book of prayers reveals how, like a child with a parent, people have always come to God&#x2015;and God invites you to do the same.</p><p>In most English translations, the Psalms sound smooth and polished. Elizabethan rhythms and style dominate. As literature, they are beyond compare. But as prayers&#x2014;expressions of anger, praise, and lament toward God&#x2014;a vital feature of them is often overlooked.<br><br>&#x201c;Prayer is elemental, not advanced, language,&#x201d; writes biblical languages scholar Eugene H. Peterson. &#x201c;It is the means by which our language becomes honest, true, and personal. In the original Hebrew, the Psalms are not genteel&#x2014;they&#x2019;re earthy and rough. They are not the prayers of nice people, couched in cultured language. But they have an immense range of gut-level honesty and passion that provides them with terrific energy.&#x201d; <br><br>Peterson brings these ancient prayers to life for modern readers by translating the rhythm and idiom of the original Hebrew into American English, all while maintaining the song-like meter and lyrical quality of your favorite translations. If this is your introduction to the Psalms, you will understand them instantly. And if you are a longtime student of the Word of God, you're invited to read the Psalms again&#x2014;for the very first time.EUGENE H. PETERSON is a writer, poet, and retired pastor. He has authored more than thirty-four books (not including The Message). He is Professor Emeritus of Spiritual Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. Eugene also founded Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, where he ministered for twenty-nine years. After teaching at a seminary, he created The Message, a vibrant Bible paraphrase that connects with today's readers like no other. <br><br>It took Peterson ten years to complete. He worked not from any English text but from the original Hebrew and Greek texts to guarantee authenticity. At the same time, his ear was always tuned to the cadence and energy of the English spoken every day on the streets. He lives with his wife, Jan, in Montana.</p><h2>Breaking Free: A Step-by-Step Divorce Guide to Achieving Emotional, Physical &amp; Spiritual Freedom</h2><p>Skip the hassle. Save the fees.

I mean, it was huge, full of books and old paintings. And deserted, you know? That kind of dead silence that says just shut your mouth and feel the awe of history. And then Marcus&#x2019;s mom came through the door like she hadn&#x2019;t seen us, reading some papers she had in her hand, and she says, &#x201c;Hi sweetheart, you brought some friends home? I&#x2019;ll catch up with you later.&#x201d; Then she was gone. I saw the look on Marcus&#x2019;s face, and knew right then that the guy needed a brother a whole lot more than he needed a library. </i><br>(Carlos Santiago, describing his first visit to Marcus Fenix&#x2019;s family mansion at the age of ten.) <br><br>Ephyra, present day&#x2013;14 A.E. <br><br>Dom Santiago decided that there was one good thing about a phantom sniper blowing a Locust&#x2019;s brains all over his face. It took his mind off worrying how many Locust were still around. His legs were shaking as he moved to the edge of the pit that had opened in the paving and aimed his rifle below, just in case the grubs had backup on the way. The shakes were just the aftershock of the adrenaline, but&#x2013; <br><br><i>Liar. I nearly shit myself. The grub was choking the life out of me, a round missed my brain by inches. That&#x2019;s fear. Forget the adrenaline. <br></i><br>No, it never stopped being terrifying. The day it did, he&#x2019;d <i>really </i>be dead. In the tangle of broken pipes and cables below, nothing stirred beyond the clicking of settling soil and stones. Dom couldn&#x2019;t feel anything under his boots now except the slight rocking movement of broken paving. The vibrations from deep in the planet had vanished for the time being, and the smell of chargrilled dog had been overwhelmed by shattered bowels and pulverized concrete. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, smart-ass,&#x201d; Baird called to the empty street. &#x201c;Nice shot. Now show yourself.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Better shout louder,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;He could be a mile away.&#x201d; <br><br>It was always hard to spot a sniper. But in this maze of destruction and shadows, there were a thousand places to lay up and wait for trade. Marcus squatted down and examined what was left of the Locust&#x2019;s skull again. Then he looked up and gestured in the general direction of the south side of the street. <br><br>&#x201c;No, a lot closer. The round went in near the top of the skull. High angle, and a lot of kinetic energy left.&#x201d; <br><br>Dom looked where Marcus was pointing, trying to work out where the sniper would have had clear line of sight. Marcus backed slowly to the nearest wall and pressed his fingers to his earpiece. Dom listened in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Delta to Control, any sniper teams to the south of Embry? Any Gears at all?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Negative, Delta.&#x201d; It was Lieutenant Stroud: Anya Stroud, still on duty after eighteen hours. The woman never seemed to sleep. If Delta Squad was awake&#x2013;so was she. &#x201c;Need one?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not anymore.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave me in suspense, Sergeant...&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a joker loose with an obsolete sniper rifle. He&#x2019;s helpful now, but he might not stay that way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for the heads- up. I&#x2019;ll put out an advisory.&#x201d; <br><br>Cole was still focused on the roofline. Baird lowered his Lancer and started walking again. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out. Maybe they got a sudden dose of patriotism and realized they owe us, now the war&#x2019;s nearly over.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Marcus said, &#x201c;he was aiming at Dom and missed. And it&#x2019;s not over.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Stranded never fire on us. They&#x2019;re not that dumb.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Old rifle. Great shot.&#x201d; Marcus reloaded, casual and ap�parently in no hurry. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;m curious.&#x201d; <br><br>Baird didn&#x2019;t look back as he picked his way over fallen masonry. &#x201c;Plenty of Stranded are good shots. Doesn&#x2019;t mean we have to go find them and enlist them.&#x201d; <br><br>Baird had a point. As long as nobody was shooting at them, it wasn&#x2019;t their problem. But if someone had a sniper rifle, Dom knew it was stolen. Obsolete or not, the things were scarce. A handful of factories struggled to produce spares, let alone crank out new weapons. Every operational piece of kit, from Ravens to Armadillos to assault rifles, was a losing battle between maintenance and decay. Like all Gears, Dom cannibalized parts from anything he could grab. Baird was a master at it. <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, we need to know,&#x201d; Dom said. &#x201c;Because if the rifle isn&#x2019;t stolen, that means the owner&#x2019;s one of us. A veteran.&#x201d; <br><br>Baird paused to pick up something. When he held it closer to his face to examine it, Dom could see it was a servo part of some kind. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s old kit and they&#x2019;re thieving scum.&#x201d; Baird pocketed the servo. <br><br>&#x201c;Because no Gear is going to hang around with street vermin if he&#x2019;s capable of shooting.&#x201d; <br><br>Again, the cocky little bastard was right. Dom wanted to see him proved wrong someday, if only to shut his mouth for a while. Yes, veteran Gears reenlisted after Emergence Day, even some <i>really </i>old guys, because there were two choices for any man worth a damn: fight with the COG forces, any way he could&#x2013;or rot. The only excuse for not fighting the Locust was being dead. <br><br>&#x201c;Every rifle counts,&#x201d; Dom called after him. No, the war<i> wasn&#x2019;t </i>over. &#x201c;And every man.&#x201d; He turned to Marcus and gestured toward the likely direction of fire. &#x201c;Give me ten minutes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got me curious, too,&#x201d; Cole said, resting his Lancer against his shoulder. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll join you.&#x201d; <br><br>Marcus sighed. &#x201c;Okay, but keep your comm channels open. Baird? Baird, get your ass back here.&#x201d; <br><br>Half of this city block had been a bank&#x2019;s headquarters, surrounded by snack and coffee shops that lived off the army of clerks. It was all derelict now. Dom could just about remember how it had looked before E- Day, the ranks of neatly wrapped sandwiches in the window displays, filled with the kind of delicacies nobody could get hold of now. Food in the army was . . . adequate, better than anything that Stranded had. But it wasn&#x2019;t fun. <br><br><i>Dog. Damn, who&#x2019;d eat a dog? <br></i><br>The glittering granite fa�ade was just a shell now, with a few hardy plants rooted in cracks in the ashlars. Nothing much grew here. It didn&#x2019;t get the chance. Dom and Cole edged inside the burned- out bank and looked up to see that there were no floors, and nowhere to hide. It was a big empty box. Everything that could be hauled away and reused&#x2013;wood, metal, cable, pipes&#x2013;had been scavenged long before. <br><br>&#x201c;Well, shit,&#x201d; Cole said cheerfully. &#x201c;I had my fortune stashed here.&#x201d; <br><br>Cole had been a pro thrashball star, a rich man in a world long gone. Wealth was measured in skills and barter now. He always treated his worthless millions as a big joke; he could find humor in just about any situation. But there was nothing much left to buy that a Gear needed. Dom decided that when life returned to normal&#x2013;even after fourteen years, he <i>had </i>to think that it could&#x2013;he&#x2019;d follow Cole&#x2019;s example and treat money as easy come, easy go. <i>People </i>were what mattered. You couldn&#x2019;t replace them, and they didn&#x2019;t earn interest. They just slipped away a day at a time, and you had to make the most of every precious moment. <br><br><i>When I find Maria, I won&#x2019;t take a single minute for granted. <br></i><br>Dom scanned the interior and peered down into a deep crater where the polished marble counter had once been. Nothing moved, but he could see the old vaults, doors blown open. &#x201c;Yeah, better cancel the order for that yacht.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Dom, you won&#x2019;t find no snipers down there.&#x201d; Cole shoved him in the shoulder. &#x201c;Heads up.&#x201d; <br><br>The back of the bank building was a sloping mound of rubble and debris, like scree that had tumbled down a mountainside. Above the ramp of brick, stone facing, and snapped joists, the rear wall rose like a cliff and the top row of empty window frames formed deep arches. Now <i>that </i>was a good position for a sniper&#x2013;depending on what was behind the wall, of course. Dom slung his Lancer across his shoulders and scrambled up the slope for a better look. <br><br>&#x201c;Nobody home, Dom.&#x201d; Cole followed him. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you get enough exercise?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Just want a look- see from the top.&#x201d; Dom grabbed at a rusted steel bar and hauled himself up the stumps of joists that jutted from the wall. His oversized boots weren&#x2019;t ideal for climbing and he had to rely on his upper body strength more than momentum from his legs, so getting down again was going to be interesting. &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;d have to be at this height to get that shot in.&#x201d; <br><br>Dom heaved himself onto a windowsill and stood with his hands braced against the stone uprights on either side. It was a big solid wall, built like a bastion, and thick enough for him to stand on comfortably even in a Gear&#x2019;s boots. On the other side, adjacent buildings in various states of col�lapse provided crude stairs down to ground level. If anyone had been up here, he&#x2019;d had a relatively easy route down. <br><br>&#x201c;See anything?&#x201d; Cole called. <br><br>&#x201c;Usual shit.&#x201d; Dom scanned one- eighty degrees. &#x201c;Not exactly a postcard to send home. Unless you live in an even bigger cesspit.&#x201d; <br><br>Below, the city still looked like a deserted battlefield, ster�ile and treeless. Smoke curled upward in thin wisps from domestic fires Dom couldn&#x2019;t see. There was a visible demarcation between the parts of the city that stood on thick granite&#x2013;the last COG stronghold&#x2013;and the outlying areas where fissures and softer rock let the Locust tunnel in. The line lay between a recognizable city, buildings mostly in one piece, and a devastated hinterland. The line itself&#x2013;well, that was the margin in which most Stranded seemed to live, the unsecured areas where they took their chances. <br><br><i>Their choice. Not ours. <br></i><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the view Dom was used to from the crew bay of a King Raven chopper. It was static, deceptively peaceful, not racing and rolling beneath him in a sequence of dis�jointed images. He had a few moments to think. Even after ten years, he found himself trying to visualize where Maria might be now. Then he began wondering how they&#x2019;d ever rebuild Sera, and the idea was so overwhelming that he did the sensible thing and just thought about how he was going to get through the next few hours alive. <br><br>&#x201c;Dom, stand there much longer, and somebody&#x2019;s going to shoot your ass off for the hell of it,&#x201d; Cole called. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s commandeer a vehicle and cover some ground.&#x201d; <br><br>Dom wasn&#x2019;t so sure the sniper had gone far. It was hard to move fast across terrain like this. You had to crawl, climb, burrow, duck. And that made it perfect to hide in. Whoever he was&#x2013;Dom was sure he&#x2019;d hang around. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d; Dom tried not to think about the drop below. He just turned around and jumped, relying on the give in the loose rock and the thick soles of his boots to cushion the impact. It still shook him to his teeth. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s making a point. Not sure what, but...&#x201d; <br><br>But Marcus had news to take his mind off the sniper. &#x201c;Move it, guys. Echo&#x2019;s got grubs surfacing three klicks west. Means they might still be moving along the Sovereign Boulevard fissure. We can get there before anyone gets a Raven airborne.&#x201d; <br><br>Marcus&#x2019;s voice rarely varied from a weary monotone. Even when he had to shout, all he did was turn up the vol�ume. There was seldom any trace of anger or urgency, al�though Dom knew damn well that it was all still battened down, and there certainly wasn&#x2019;t any hint of triumph now. <br><br>&#x201c;Numbers?&#x201d; Dom asked. <br><br>&#x201c;A dozen.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But that means they&#x2019;re thinning out,&#x201d; Baird said. He fancied himself as the resident Locust expert, and he was. &#x201c;Looks like we did it. We bombed the shit out of them.&#x201d; <br><br>Dom prodded Baird in the chest as he passed him, friendly but pointed. &#x201c;You mean <i>Marcus </i>did it.

Most patrols were on foot, out of neces�sity; APCs were in ever shorter supply. &#x201c;The stragglers could still outnumber us. Do a head count.&#x201d; <br><br>Dom prided himself on hanging in there, just like his dad, just like his brother Carlos. You didn&#x2019;t lose heart. You didn&#x2019;t lose hope. <i>Resilience, </i>Carlos called it; a man had to be <i>resilient, </i>and not crumble at the first setback. But after fourteen years of fighting, there were only a few million humans left, and Dom was ready to grab at any prospect of the nightmare coming to an end. <br><br><i>No, it&#x2019;ll be a different kind of nightmare. Restarting civ�ilization from scratch. But it beats thinking every day will be your last. <br></i><br>The only thing that bothered Dom about dying now was that it would end his hunt for Maria. <br><br>&#x201c;Right behind you,&#x201d; he said, and ran after Marcus.</p><h2>Slavonic Fairy Tales</h2><p>Poland, Russia, Bohemia, and Servia have contributed stories to this little collection. It may be said that the Bohemian tales, perhaps through the genius of the poets who have preserved them, have, in their original form, more art, more grace, more completeness of outline, than the others. Those from Poland reflect the passive virtues and genial warmth of the peasants whose lives they illustrate. A greater simplicity, amounting even to childishness, will be found to characterise the Russian stories. Those from Servia are in some features unique, and may be found the most interesting of the series. The exalted imagination of the Servian race is allied with keen and homely sense, and their vigorous and beautiful romances called forth the admiration of Goethe. It is hoped that these varied characteristics may not wholly have evaporated in translation. (From the Preface.)This delightful book contains forty tales from the Slavonic lands, entitled as follows:Carried Away by the WindWhy is the Sole of Man&#x2019;s Foot Uneven?The Snow-ChildThe Demon&#x2019;s DanceThe Plague-OmenStory of Gol VoyanskyLidushka and the Water Demon&#x2019;s WifeThe Hare&#x2019;s HeartThe Wonderful HairStory of Vasilisa with the Golden Tress,and of Ivan the PeaThe Emperor Trojan&#x2019;s Goat&#x2019;s EarsThe Language of AnimalsThe Evil EyeHuntsman the UnluckyHow to Choose a WifeThe PlagueGolden HairThe Plague and the PeasantHandicraft above EverythingIvan KruchinaRight and WrongMen-WolvesYanechek and the Water DemonSpirit TreasuresJust Earnings are Never LostStory of Little SimpletonJonekThe Maiden who was Swifterthan the HorseThe Book of MagicThe Wise JudgmentTwardowskiThe Maiden who was Wiserthan the KingMadeyThe Long-desired ChildThe Wicked Wood-FaysThe Wonderful BirdWisdom and FortuneThe Three BrothersThe Brownie, or House SpiritAll about Twopence</p><p></p><h2>The Accident: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>From the author of the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling and Edgar Award-winning <i>The Expats</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>As dawn approaches in New York, literary agent Isabel Reed is turning the final pages of a mysterious, anonymous manuscript, racing through the explosive revelations about powerful people, as well as long-hidden secrets about her own past. In Copenhagen, veteran CIA operative Hayden Gray, determined that this sweeping story be buried, is suddenly staring down the barrel of an unexpected gun. And in Zurich, the author himself is hiding in a shadowy expat life, trying to atone for a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of lies and betrayals with publication of <i>The Accident, </i>while always looking over his shoulder.<br><br>Over the course of one long, desperate, increasingly perilous day, these lives collide as the book begins its dangerous march toward publication, toward saving or ruining careers and companies, placing everything at risk&#x2014;and everyone in mortal peril.&nbsp; The rich cast of characters&#x2014;in publishing and film, politics and espionage&#x2014;are all forced to confront the consequences of their ambitions, the schisms between their ideal selves and the people they actually became.<br><br>The action rockets around Europe and across America, with an intricate web of duplicities stretching back a quarter-century to a dark winding road in upstate New York, where the shocking truth about the accident itself is buried. <br><br>Gripping, sophisticated, layered, and impossible to put down, <i>The Accident</i> proves once again that Chris Pavone is a true master of suspense.</p></p><p><p>Chris Pavone's&nbsp;novel <i>The Expats</i> was a <i>New York Times, USA Today,</i> and international bestseller, and winner of Edgar and Anthony awards for best first novel. Chris grew up in Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell, and was a book editor for nearly two decades, as well as an expat in Luxembourg, but now lives again in New York City with his wife and children. <i>The Accident</i> is his second novel.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>It&#x2019;s just before dawn when Isabel Reed turns the final sheet of paper. Halfway down the page, her mouth falls open, her heartbeat quickens. Her eyes dart across each typescript line at a rapid-fire pace, accelerating as she moves through the final paragraph, desperate to arrive at a revelation, to confirm her suspicions. She sucks in her breath, and holds that breath, for the last lines.<br><br>Isabel stares at the final period, the little black dot of ink . . . staring . . . <br><br>She lets out her breath. &#x201c;My God.&#x201d; Astounded, at the enormity of the story. Disappointed, at the absence of the confirmation she was hoping for. Furious, at what it means. Terrified, at the dangers it presents. And, above all, heartbroken, at the immensity of the betrayal. Betrayals.<br><br>She puts the page down on the fat stack of paper that sits on the bedspread, next to a crumpled soft-pack of cigarettes and an overflowing crystal ashtray, a mildly snarky birthday present from a passive-aggressive colleague. She picks up the manuscript with both hands, flips it over, and uses her thumbs to align the pages. Her hands are trembling. She tries to steady herself with a deep breath, and sets the straightened pile of pages in her lap. There are four words centered at the top of the page:<br>The Accident by Anonymous<br>Isabel stares across the room, off into the black nothingness of the picture window on the opposite wall, its severe surface barely softened by the half-drawn shades, an aggressive void invading the cocoon of her bedroom. The room is barely lit by a small bullet-shaped reading sconce mounted over the headboard, aiming a concentrated beam of light directly at her. In the window, the light&#x2019;s reflection hovers above her face, like a tiny sun illuminating the top of her head, creating a halo. An angel. Except she&#x2019;s not.<br><br>She can feel her body tense and her jaw tighten and her shoulders contract in a spasm of rage. She tries to suppress it, bites her lip, brings herself under the flimsiest tether of control.<br><br>Isabel draws aside the bedspread, struggles to a sitting position. It&#x2019;s been hours since she has shifted her body in any appreciable way, and her legs and back are stiff and achy--old, if she had to choose a word for her joints. Her legs dangle over the side of the mattress, her toes searching for the fleece-lined slippers.<br><br>Along the wall, long slivers of aluminum shelves--hundreds of horizontal feet--are filled with neat stacks of manuscripts, their authors&#x2019; names written with thick black Sharpie into the sides of the stacks of pages. Tens of thousands of pages of proposed books of every sort, promising a wide assortment of entertainment and information, produced with a broad range of skill levels.<br><br>These days, everyone younger than Isabel seems to read manuscripts and proposals on e-readers; quite a few of those older, too. But she feels uncomfortable, unnatural, sitting there holding a little device in her hands. Isabel is of the generation that&#x2019;s just old enough to be congenitally uncomfortable with new technologies. When she started her first job, she didn&#x2019;t have a computer at her desk. A year later, she did.<br><br>Maybe next year she&#x2019;ll start using one of those things, but for now she&#x2019;s still reading on paper, turning pages, making notes with pens, surrounding herself with stacks of paper, like bricks, bunkered against the relentless onslaught of the future. And for The Accident, she didn&#x2019;t even have a choice. Because although nearly all of new projects are now delivered to her office electronically, this submission was not.<br><br>She shuffles down the hall, through the darkness. Turns on the kitchen lights, and the coffee machine--switched from AUTO-ON, which is set to start brewing an hour from now, to ON--and the small television. Filling the silent lonely apartment with humming electronic life.<br><br>Isabel had been reading frantically, hoping to discover the one assertion that rang untrue, the single mismatched thread that would unravel the whole narrative, growing increasingly discouraged as page 1 at the office in the morning became page two-hundred-something at home in the evening. She fell asleep sometime after eleven, more than halfway through, then woke again at two, unable to quiet her mind, anxious to get back to it. People in the book business are constantly claiming &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t put it down&#x201d; or &#x201c;it kept me up all night&#x201d; or &#x201c;I read it in one day.&#x201d; This time, all that was true.<br><br>So at two a.m. Isabel picked up the manuscript and started reading again, page after page, through the late-late night. Vaguely reminiscent of those days when Tommy was an infant, and she was sleep-deprived, awake in a dormant world. They are very discrete periods, for very specific reasons, when it&#x2019;s a normal part of life to be awake at four a.m.: it&#x2019;s for making babies or caring for them, in the small desperate hours when a blanket of quiet smothers the city, but through the moth-eaten holes there&#x2019;s the occasional lowing of a railroad in New Jersey, the distant Dopplered wail of an ambulance siren. Then the inevitable thump of the newspaper on the doormat, the end of the idea of night, even if it&#x2019;s still dark out.<br><br>Nothing she encountered during the 488 pages seemed false. Now she stares at the anchor&#x2019;s face on the television, tuned to Wolfe . . . That goddamned son of a bitch . . . <br><br>Her anger swells, and she loses control--<br><br>Isabel cocks her arm and hurls the remote across the kitchen, cracking and splintering against the refrigerator door, clattering loudly to the floor. Then the heightened silence of the aftermath, the subdued thrum of a double-A battery rolling across the tile, the impotent click as it comes to rest against a baseboard.<br><br>She feels tears trickling down her cheek, and wipes them away.<br><br>The coffee machine hisses and sputters the final drops, big plops falling into the tempered glass. Isabel glances at the contraption&#x2019;s clock, changing from 5:48 to 5:49, in the corner of the neatly organized counter, a study in right angles of brushed stainless steel. Isabel is a passionate proponent of perfect alignment. Fanatical, some might say.<br><br>She opens the refrigerator door, with its new scratch from the airborne remote, whose jagged pieces she kicks out of her way. She takes out the quart of skim and pours a splash into her mug. She grabs the plastic handle of the carafe and fills the mug with hot, viscous, bitter, bracing caffeination. She takes a small sip, then a larger one. She tops up the mug, and again wipes away tears.<br><br>She walks back down the now-lighted hall, lined with the family photographs she&#x2019;d unearthed when she was moving out of her matrimonial apartment, into this single-woman space in a new neighborhood, far from the painful memories of her home--of her life--downtown, where she&#x2019;d been running into too many mothers, often with their children. Women she&#x2019;d known from the playgrounds and toy stores and mommy-and-me music classes, from the gyms and grocers and coffee shops, from preschool drop-off and the pediatrician&#x2019;s waiting room. All those other little children growing older, getting bigger, Emmas and Stellas in precious little plaids, Ashers and Amoses with mops of messy curls in skinny jeans on scooters; all those self-satisfied downtown bobo parents, unabashedly proud of their progeny&#x2019;s precociousness.<br><br>She&#x2019;d bought herself a one-bedroom in a full-service uptown co-op, the type of apartment that a woman chooses when she becomes reconciled that she&#x2019;s not going to be living with another human being. She had reached that age, that stage, when a lifestyle starts to look permanent: it is what it is, and ever will be, until you die. She was making her loneliness as comfortable as possible. Palliative care.<br><br>If she wasn&#x2019;t allergic to cats, there&#x2019;d probably be a couple of them lurking around, scrutinizing her disdainfully.<br><br>Isabel lined this nice new hallway--parquet floors, ornate moldings, electrical outlets where she wants them--with framed photos. There she is, a smiling little toddler being held aloft by her tragically beautiful mother in Central Park, at the playground near the museum, a couple of blocks from the Classic 8 on Park Avenue that her parents couldn&#x2019;t actually afford. And then hand-in-hand with her remarkably unambitious father, starting fourth grade at the small-town public school in the Hudson Valley, after they&#x2019;d finally abandoned the city for their &#x201c;country place,&#x201d; the old family estate that they&#x2019;d been selling off, half-acre parcels at a time, to pay for their life. Then in cap and gown, the high school valedictorian, bound not for Harvard or Yale or even a first-rate state school, but for a second-tier--maybe third?--private college upstate, because it offered a full scholarship, including room and board, and didn&#x2019;t necessitate expensive out-of-state travel. The drive was just a few hours.<br><br>Her parents had called her Belle; still do. But once she was old enough to understand what the word meant, she couldn&#x2019;t bear to lay claim to it. She began to insist on Isabel.<br><br>Isabel had intended to go to graduate school, to continue studying American literature, eventually to teach at the university level, maybe. But that plan was formed before she&#x2019;d had an understanding of the realities of personal finance. She took what she thought would be a short-term job at a publishing house--one of her father&#x2019;s school chums was a famous editor--with the irrational expectation that she&#x2019;d be able to save money to pay for school, in a year, or two. She was buoyed by modest success in an enjoyable workplace during good business years, and one thing led to another. Plus she never saved a dime. By the time she was twenty-five, she no longer thought about grad school. Almost never.<br><br>So then there she is, in a little black dress on stage at a book-award ceremony, accepting on behalf of her author who was in South America at the time, chasing a new story. And in a big white dress, aglow, in the middle of the panoramic-lens group shot, the thirty-six-year-old bride with her bridesmaids, at her wedding to a man she&#x2019;d started dating a mere eight months earlier, short on time, perfectly willing to turn a blind eye to his obvious faults, the personality traits that her friends were too supportive to point out, until the safe remove of hindsight.<br><br>That utter bastard.<br><br>It still amazes her how quickly youth slipped away, how severely her options narrowed. Just a couple of bad relationship decisions--one guy who as it turned out was never going to commit, another who was a closeted asshole--and the infinite choices of her late twenties turned into the dwindling selection of her mid-thirties, now saying yes to any non-creepy men who asked her out at parties or introduced themselves in bars, sometimes using her middle name if the guy was on the margins of acceptability and she might end up wanting to hide behind the unstalkable shield of an alias; over the years she&#x2019;d had more than a few dates with men who thought her name was something else. Half the time, she was glad for the deception.<br><br>Another photo, a smaller print, lying in the hospital bed with Tommy in her arms, tiny and red and angry in his striped swaddling blanket and blue cap. Isabel returned to work after the standard three months, but in that quarter-year something had passed, and she was complacent to allow it. Her husband was suddenly making embarrassing amounts of money, so Isabel hired a housekeeper to go with the nanny. She started leading one of those enviable-looking lives--a four-day workweek, driving the shiny car from the pristine loft to the shingled beach house, a perfect baby and a rich handsome smart funny husband . . . <br><br>And then.<br><br>She stops at the final photo, spotlit, a small black-and-white in the center of an expanse of stark-white matting. A little boy, laughing on a rocky beach, running out of the gentle surf, wearing water wings. Isabel reaches her hand to her lips, plants a kiss on her fingers, and transfers the kiss to the little boy. As she does every morning.<br><br>Isabel continues to the bathroom, unbuttoning her flannel top as she walks, untying the drawstring of the pajama bottoms, which crumple as she releases the knot. She pushes her panties down and steps out of them, leaving a small, tight puddle of cotton on the floor.<br><br>The hot shower punishes her tense, tired shoulders. Steam billows in thick bursts, pulled out the bathroom door, spilling into the dressing area, the bedroom. The water fills her ears, drowning out any sounds of the television, of the world. If there&#x2019;s anything else in her apartment making noise, she can&#x2019;t hear it.<br><br>What exactly is she going to do with this manuscript? She shakes water out of her hair, licks her top lip, shifts her hands, her feet, her weight, standing under the stream, distracted and disarmed, distressed. It all beats down on her, the shower stream and the manuscript and the boy and the past, and the old guilt plus the new guilt, and the new earth-shattering truths, and fear for her career and maybe, now, fear for her life.<br><br>She slips into a soft, thick white bathrobe, towel-dries her hair. She sweeps her hand across the steamed-up glass, and examines her tired eyes, bagged and bloodshot, wrinkled at the corners. The bathroom&#x2019;s high-voltage lighting isn&#x2019;t doing her any favors this morning. She had long ago become accustomed to not sleeping well, for a variety of reasons. But with each passing year, it has become harder and harder to hide the physical evidence of sleeplessness.<br><br>From the other room, she can hear the irrelevant prattle of the so-called news, the piddling dramas of box-office grosses, petty marital indiscretions, celebrity substance abuse. Steam recolonizes the mirror, and she watches big thick drops of condensation streak down from the top beveled edge of the glass, cutting narrow paths of clarity through the fog, thin clear lines in which she can glimpse her reflection . . . <br><br>Something is different, and a jolt of nervous electricity shoots through her, a flash of an image, Hitchcockian terror. Something in that slim clear streak has changed. The light has shifted, there&#x2019;s now a darkness, a shadow--<br><br>But it&#x2019;s nothing, she sees, just the reflection of the bedroom TV, more footage of yesterday&#x2019;s international news, today. Today she has to consider the news in a whole new light. Now and forevermore.<br><br>She gets dressed, a sleek navy skirt suit over a crisp white blouse, low heels. The type of office attire for someone who wants to look good, without particularly caring about being fashionable. She blow-dries, brushes her shoulder-length blonde hair, applies makeup. Sets contacts into her hazel eyes. She assesses herself--tired-looking, inarguably middle-aged--in the full-length mirror, and sighs, disappointed. Three hours of sleep pushes the limit of what makeup can accomplish.</p><h2>Born to Drum: The Truth About the World&#39;s Greatest Drummers--from John Bonham and Keith Moon to Sheila E. and Dave Grohl</h2><p><p>&#x201c;An engaging journey into the wild and wonderful world of drumming.&#x201d;&#x2014;CLEM BURKE, Blondie</p><p>To have a great band you need a great drummer.

But as beloved author and Bible scholar J. I. Packer probes the purpose and true meaning of the Ten Commandments, you'll discover that these precepts can aptly be called God's blueprint for the best life possible. They contain the wisdom and priorities everyone needs for relational, spiritual, and societal blessing-and it's all coming from a loving heavenly Father who wants the best for his children.</p><p>Not only does Packer deliver these truths in brief, readable segments, but he includes discussion questions and ideas for further study at the end of each chapter.

A good brief discussion appears on what would be true for Christianity if Jesus had not risen. Packer also has good reasons Christians can validly believe that Jesus did rise.

Packer clothes doctrine with practical everyday living applications."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Glen H. Jones</strong>, Pulpit Helps</p><p>"Packer does an exceptionally fine job of providing simple analyses of profound material. His insights invite further reflection, development, and discussion.

Nearly two decades later, Immacul�e continues to pray the rosary every day and marvels at how she is constantly renewed and richly rewarded by rejoicing in this glorious prayer. It has helped her in every aspect of her life, from literally saving her life to strengthening her faith, easing sorrows, changing heartache into happiness, healing illnesses in herself and others, solving family problems, landing a dream job, finding long-lost friends, and even locating lost keys! She received so many blessings from the rosary, in fact, that she decided to study its history and origins. She soon discovered that it was not just meant for Catholics, but that the Virgin Mary promised a life filled with blessings to everyone from any religion who faithfully recited the rosary daily . . . and this was such wonderful news that she vowed to share it with as many people as she could. In The Rosary: The Prayer That Saved My Life, Immacul�e reveals how the rosary&#x2019;s many blessings can be reaped by each and every one of us. In this moving and uplifting book, the New York Times bestselling author recounts her personal experience of discovering the power and the beauty of the ancient beads&#x2014;and shows all of us how to enrich our own lives by exploring and embracing the mysteries, secrets, and promises of the prayer that became her "lifeline to heaven."</p><p>Immacul�e Ilibagiza, the author of Left to Tell, Led by Faith, Our Lady of Kibeho, and The Boy Who Met Jesus (with Steve Erwin), was born in Rwanda and studied electronic and mechanical engineering at the National University.

Our whole class had been looking forward to this field trip all week. My best friends, Frankie and Ashley, were sitting in the seat in front of me. I had the bad luck to have gotten Nick McKelty as my partner. That meant I had to sit next to him on the bus. And that meant I had very little seat. Nick the Tick&#x2019;s thick body took up most of it. I don&#x2019;t mean to gross you out, but my right butt cheek was riding in the air.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you most want to see at the zoo?&#x201d; Ms. Flowers asked as she walked up and down the aisle collecting our lunches. One of the parents, Ms.&nbsp;Shimozato, held the big yellow container where our lunches would be kept until it was time to eat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A giant squid,&#x201d; Luke Whitman said, handing her his brown bag with a salami grease mark covering the bottom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to the zoo, Luke, not the aquarium,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers answered. Her voice sounded like she was holding her nose, even though she wasn&#x2019;t. That happens a lot around Luke. &#x201c;What about you, Hank?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I want to see a giraffe tongue,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hear they&#x2019;re purple and covered in hair.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So are you, Zipper Fang,&#x201d; Nick said. He threw his arms up in the air and burst out laughing at his usual not-funny joke. That one movement put my nose right next to his armpit, which is not a place any nose wants to be. It smelled like rotten eggs on toast. <br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Giraffe tongues are dark in color to protect them from getting sunburned,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers said. &#x201c;Their tongues are out a lot when they&#x2019;re picking leaves off trees.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That set off a lot of conversation about weird-but-true animal facts. It seemed like everyone on the bus knew one. It was a fun way to spend the bus ride.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Spiders have eight legs and forty-eight knees,&#x201d; Katie Sperling said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kangaroos cannot walk backward,&#x201d; Frankie chimed in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tigers have striped skin, not just striped fur,&#x201d; Ryan Shimozato said. His mom smiled proudly, as if she had said it herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Elephants are the only animals that can&#x2019;t jump,&#x201d; Ashley said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because they can weigh up to fifteen thousand pounds. Hard to get that off the ground.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I love them, anyway,&#x201d; I said to Ashley. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve watched lots of shows about them on television. I hope we get to see one today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, Hank, I think you&#x2019;re going to get your wish,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers said. &#x201c;There is an elephant enclosure at the zoo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can we go there first?&#x201d; I begged.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have a tour guide who has the whole morning planned for us,&#x201d; Ms. Flowers said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important that we all stay together. Remember our most important rule&#x2014;no wandering away. And that goes especially for you, Hank.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t even have to say why. I knew what she meant. I get lost a lot. Maybe it&#x2019;s because I still can&#x2019;t tell my left from my right. Last week, Ms.&nbsp;Flowers gave me the attendance sheet to take to the office. She said to walk to the end of the hall and turn right, then go to the water fountain and turn left. I thought I followed her directions perfectly. That is, until I pulled the door open and walked right into the girls&#x2019; bathroom. Lucky for me, it was empty.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The zoo is very large,&#x201d; Ms.&nbsp;Flowers explained as we pulled into the parking lot. &#x201c;You are each responsible to always know where your partner is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> After we entered the zoo, we met our tour guide, Gina, who told us our first stop was Gorilla World. While she was telling us all about what we were going to see, I noticed Nick wandering away. He was heading for a cart that sold toy zoo animals. Since he was my partner, it was my responsibility to tell him to stay with the group. His back was to me, so I couldn&#x2019;t see what he was doing. I snuck over to him and whispered in his ear, so Ms. Flowers couldn&#x2019;t hear. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to be here,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, he wheeled around and flashed what looked like a rat in front of my face. Before I could do anything, he dropped it down the front of my shirt. It felt cold and sticky. <br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Aarrgh!&#x201d; I screamed, before I could stop myself. I pulled my shirt out of my pants, and the sticky thing fell out the bottom of my shirt to the ground. I looked down and saw it was just a rubber rat. I turned around to tell McKelty how annoying that was, but he had already snuck back to the group. So I stood there alone, with everyone in the class laughing at me. Everyone but Ms.&nbsp;Flowers. She did not look happy.<br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Hank,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What was the last thing I said to you on the bus? No wandering away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But Ms. Flowers, I was just trying to be responsible.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, you didn&#x2019;t succeed, Hank. Now please apologize to Gina for interrupting her introduction to Gorilla World.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> I apologized, but it wasn&#x2019;t fair. It was McKelty who had wandered away. I had only gone after him to help. We started down the path that led to the gorillas.<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked at Frankie and Ashley, who were at the front of the line asking Gina lots of questions. They seemed really<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have a fun day with you, Zipperbutt,&#x201d; McKelty said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my favorite kind of partner. You make the animals in this zoo seem smart.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;happy. Then I looked at Nick McKelty next to me, who snickered just before he tripped me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watch your step,&#x201d; the big creep said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only one thought was running through my mind: <i>Why did I get stuck with this guy?</i></p><h2>When the Rivers Run Dry, Fully Revised and Updated Edition: Water-The Defining Crisis of the Twenty-First Century</h2><p><b>A new edition of the veteran science writer's groundbreaking work on the world's water crisis, featuring all-new reporting from the most recent global flashpoints</b><br><br>Throughout history, rivers have been our foremost source of fresh water for both agriculture and individual consumption, but looming water scarcity threatens to cut global food production and cause conflict and unrest. In this visionary book, Fred Pearce takes readers around the world on a tour of the world's rivers to provide our most complete portrait yet of the growing global water crisis and its ramifications for us all. With vivid on-the-ground reporting, Pearce deftly weaves together the scientific, economic, and historic dimensions of the water crisis, showing us its complex origins--from waste to wrong-headed engineering projects to high-yield crop varieties that have saved developing countries from starvation but are now emptying their water reserves. Pearce argues that the solution to the growing worldwide water shortage is more efficiency and a new water ethic based on managing the water cycle for maximum social benefit rather than narrow self-interest.</p><p><b>Fred Pearce</b> is an award-winning author and journalist based in London.

He begins with Copernicus, during the Renaissance, when science replaced mysticism as a means of explaining the workings of the world, and he continues through the centuries, creating an unbroken genealogy of not only the greatest but also the more obscure names of Western science, a dot-to-dot line linking amateur to genius, and accidental discovery to brilliant deduction.<br><br>By focusing on the scientists themselves, Gribbin has written an anecdotal narrative enlivened with stories of personal drama, success and failure. A bestselling science writer with an international reputation, Gribbin is among the few authors who could even attempt a work of this magnitude. Praised as &#x201c;a sequence of witty, information-packed tales&#x201d; and &#x201c;a terrific read&#x201d; by <i>The Times</i> upon its recent British publication, <i>The Scientists</i> breathes new life into such venerable icons as Galileo, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Linus Pauling, as well as lesser lights whose stories have been undeservedly neglected. Filled with pioneers, visionaries, eccentrics and madmen, this is the history of science as it has never been told before.</p><p><b>Praise for The Scientists<br></b> <br>&#x201c;Essential reading...tells the story of science as a sequence of witty, information-packed tales...complete with humanizing asides, glimpses of the scientist&#x2019;s personal life and amusing anecdotes.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;London Sunday Times, Books of the Year</b> <br> <br>&#x201c;Excels at making complex science intelligible to the general reader...If you&#x2019;re looking for a book that captures the personal drama and achievement of science, then look no further.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;The Guardian</b> <br> <br>&#x201c;Gripping and entertaining...wonderfully and pleasurably accessible...

He is the author of the Assassin&#x2019;s Creed tie-in novels.<b>One </b><p>Torches&nbsp;gleamed and flickered high on the towers of the Palazzo Vecchio and the Bargello, and just a few lanterns shimmered in the cathedral square a little way to the north. Some also illuminated the quays along the banks of the River Arno, where, late as it was for a city where most people retired indoors with the coming of night, a few sailors and stevedores could be seen through the gloom. Some of the sailors, still attending to their ships and boats, hastened to make final repairs to rigging and to coil rope neatly on the dark, scrubbed decks, while the stevedores hurried to haul or carry cargo to the safety of the nearby warehouses.</p><p>Lights also glimmered in the winehouses and the brothels, but very few people walked the streets. It had been seven years since the then twenty-year-old Lorenzo de&#x2019; Medici had been elected to the leadership of the city, bringing with him at least a sense of order and calm to the intense rivalry between the leading international banking and merchant families who had made Florence one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Despite this, the city had never ceased to simmer, and occasionally boil over, as each faction strove for control, some of them shifting alliances, some remaining permanent and implacable enemies.</p><p>Florence, in the Year of Our Lord 1476, even on a jasmine-sweet evening in spring, when you could almost forget the stench from the Arno if the wind was in the right direction, wasn&#x2019;t the safest place to be out in the open, after the sun had gone down.</p><p>The moon had risen in a now-cobalt sky, lording it over a host of attendant stars. Its light fell on the open square where the Ponte Vecchio, its crowded shops dark and silent now, joined the north bank of the river. Its light also found out a figure clad in black, standing on the roof of the church of Santo Stefano al Ponte. A young man, only seventeen years old, but tall and proud. Surveying the neighbourhood below keenly, he put a hand to his lips and whistled, a low but penetrating sound. In response, as he watched, first one, then three, then a dozen, and at last twenty men, young like himself, most clad in black, some with blood-red, green, or azure cowls or hats, all with swords and daggers at their belts, emerged from dark streets and archways into the square. The gang of dangerous-looking youths fanned out, a cocky assuredness in their movements.</p><p>The young man looked down at the eager faces, pale in the moonlight, gazing up at him. He raised his fist above his head in a defiant salute.</p><p>&#x201c;We stand together!&#x201d; he cried, as they too raised their fists, some drawing their weapons and brandishing them, and cheered: &#x201c;Together!&#x201d;</p><p>The young man quickly climbed, catlike, down the unfinished fa�ade from the roof to the church&#x2019;s portico, and from it leapt, cloak flying, to land in a crouch, safely in their midst. They gathered round, expectantly.</p><p>&#x201c;Silence, my friends!&#x201d; He held up a hand to arrest a last, lone shout. He smiled grimly. &#x201c;Do you know why I called you, my closest allies, here tonight? To ask your aid. For too long I have been silent while our enemy, you know who I mean, Vieri de&#x2019; Pazzi, has gone about this town slandering my family, dragging our name in the mud, and trying in his pathetic way to demean us. Normally I would not stoop to kicking such a mangy cur, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He was interrupted as a large, jagged rock, hurled from the direction of the bridge, landed at his feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough of your nonsense, grullo,&#x201d; a voice called.</p><p>The young man turned as one with his group in the direction of the voice. Already he knew whom it belonged to. Crossing the bridge from the south side another gang of young men was approaching. Its leader swaggered at its head, a red cloak, held by a clasp bearing a device of golden dolphins and crosses on a blue ground, over his dark velvet suit, his hand on the pommel of his sword. He was a passably handsome man, his looks marred by a cruel mouth and a weak chin, and though he was a little fat, there was no doubting the power in his arms and legs.</p><p>&#x201c;Buona sera, Vieri,&#x201d; the young man said evenly. &#x201c;We were just talking about you.&#x201d; And he bowed with exaggerated courtesy, while assuming a look of surprise. &#x201c;But you must forgive me. We were not expecting you personally. I thought the Pazzi always hired others to do their dirty work.&#x201d;</p><p>Vieri, coming close, drew himself up as he and his troop came to a halt a few yards away. &#x201c;Ezio Auditore! You pampered little whelp! I&#x2019;d say it was rather your family of penpushers and accountants that goes running to the guards whenever there&#x2019;s the faintest sign of trouble. Codardo!&#x201d; He gripped the hilt of his sword. &#x201c;Afraid to handle things yourself, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what can I say, Vieri, ciccione. Last time I saw her, your sister Viola seemed quite satisfied with the handling I gave her.&#x201d; Ezio Auditore gave his enemy a broad grin, content to hear his companions snigger and cheer behind him.</p><p>But he knew he&#x2019;d gone too far. Vieri had already turned purple with rage. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite enough from you, Ezio, you little prick! Let&#x2019;s see if you fight as well as you gabble!&#x201d; He turned his head back to his men, raising his sword. &#x201c;Kill the bastards!&#x201d; he bellowed.</p><p>At once another rock whirled through the air, but this time it wasn&#x2019;t thrown as a challenge. It caught Ezio a glancing blow on the forehead, breaking the skin and drawing blood. Ezio staggered back momentarily, as a hail of rocks flew from the hands of Vieri&#x2019;s followers. His own men barely had time to rally before the Pazzi gang was upon them, rushing over the bridge to Ezio and his men. All at once, the fighting was so close and so fast that there was hardly time at first to draw swords or even daggers, so the two gangs just went at each other with their fists.</p><p>The battle was hard and grim&#x2014;brutal kicks and punches connected with the sickening sound of crunching bone. For a while it could have gone either way, then Ezio, his vision slightly impaired by the flow of blood from his forehead, saw two of his best men stumble and go down, to be trampled on by Pazzi thugs. Vieri laughed, and, close to Ezio, swung another blow at his head, his hand grasping a heavy stone. Ezio dropped to his haunches and the blow went wide, but it had been too close for comfort, and now the Auditore faction was getting the worst of it. Ezio did manage, before he could rise to his feet, to wrestle his dagger free and slice wildly but successfully at the thigh of a heavily built Pazzi thug who was bearing down at him with sword and dagger unsheathed. Ezio&#x2019;s dagger tore through fabric and into muscle and sinew, and the man let loose an agonized howl and went over, dropping his weapons and clutching at his wound with both hands as the blood belched forth.</p><p>Scrambling desperately to his feet, Ezio looked round. He could see that the Pazzi had all but surrounded his own men, penning them in against one wall of the church. Feeling some of the strength returning to his legs, he made his way towards his fellows. Ducking under the scything blade of another Pazzi henchman, he managed to connect his fist to the man&#x2019;s stubbly jaw and had the satisfaction of seeing teeth fly and his would-be assailant fall to his knees, stunned by the blow. He yelled to his own men to encourage them, but in truth his thoughts were turning to ways of beating a retreat with as much dignity as possible, when above the noise of the fight he heard a loud, jovial, and very familiar voice calling to him from behind the Pazzi mob.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, fratellino, what the hell are you up to?&#x201d;</p><p>Ezio&#x2019;s heart pounded with relief, and he managed to gasp, &#x201c;Hey, Federico! What are you doing here? I thought you&#x2019;d be out on the tiles as usual!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonsense! I knew you had something planned, and I thought I&#x2019;d come along to see if my little brother had finally learned how to look after himself. But maybe you need another lesson or two!&#x201d;</p><p>Federico Auditore, a few years Ezio&#x2019;s senior and the oldest of the Auditore siblings, was a big man with a big appetite&#x2014;for drink, for love, and for battle. He waded in even as he was speaking, knocking two Pazzi heads together and bringing his foot up to connect with the jaw of a third as he strode through the throng to stand side by side with his brother, seeming impervious to the violence that surrounded him. Around them their own men, encouraged, redoubled their efforts. The Pazzi, on the other hand, were discomfited. A few of the dockyard hands had gathered at a safe distance to watch, and in the half-light the Pazzi mistook them for Auditore reinforcements. That and Federico&#x2019;s roars and fl ying fists, his actions quickly emulated by Ezio, who learnt fast, very quickly panicked them.</p><p>Vieri de&#x2019; Pazzi&#x2019;s furious voice rose above the general tumult. &#x201c;Fall back!&#x201d; he called to his men, his voice broken with exertion and anger. He caught Ezio&#x2019;s eye and snarled some inaudible threat before disappearing into the darkness, back across the Ponte Vecchio, followed by those of his men who could still walk, and hotly pursued by Ezio&#x2019;s now-triumphant allies.</p><p>Ezio was about to follow suit, but his brother&#x2019;s meaty hand restrained him. &#x201c;Just a minute,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean? We&#x2019;ve got them on the run!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Steady on.&#x201d; Federico was frowning, gently touching the wound on Ezio&#x2019;s brow.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a scratch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than that,&#x201d; his brother decided, a grave expression on his face. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get you to a doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezio spat. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got time to waste running to doctors. Besides . . .&#x201d; He paused ruefully. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t any money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hah! Wasted it on women and wine, I suppose.&#x201d; Federico grinned, and slapped his younger brother warmly on the shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Not wasted exactly, I&#x2019;d say. And look at the example you set me.&#x201d; Ezio grinned but then hesitated. He suddenly became aware that his head was thumping. &#x201c;Still, it wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to get it checked out. I suppose you couldn&#x2019;t see your way to lending me a few fiorini?&#x201d;</p><p>Federico patted his purse. It didn&#x2019;t jingle. &#x201c;Fact is, I&#x2019;m a bit short myself just now,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Ezio grinned at his brother&#x2019;s sheepishness. &#x201c;And what have you wasted yours on? Masses and Indulgences, I suppose?&#x201d;</p><p>Federico laughed. &#x201c;All right. I take your point.&#x201d; He looked around. In the end, only three or four of their own people had been hurt badly enough to remain on the field of battle, and they were sitting up, groaning a bit, but grinning too. It had been a tough set-to, but no one had broken any bones. On the other hand, a good half-dozen Pazzi henchmen lay completely out for the count, and one or two of them at least were expensively dressed.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if our fallen enemies have any riches to share,&#x201d; Federico suggested. &#x201c;After all, our need is greater than theirs, and I&#x2019;ll bet you can&#x2019;t lighten their load without waking them up!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see about that,&#x201d; said Ezio, and set about it with some success. Before a few minutes had elapsed, he&#x2019;d harvested enough gold coins to fill both their own purses. Ezio looked over to his brother triumphantly and jingled his newly claimed wealth to emphasize the point.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough!&#x201d; cried Federico. &#x201c;Better leave them a bit to limp home on. After all, we&#x2019;re not thieves&#x2014;this is just the spoils of war. And I still don&#x2019;t like the look of that wound. We must get it seen to double quick.&#x201d;</p><p>Ezio nodded, and turned to survey the field of the Auditore victory one last time. Losing patience, Federico rested a hand on his younger brother&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said, and without more ado he set off at such a pace that the battle-weary Ezio found it hard to keep up, though when he fell too far behind, or took a wrong turn down an alley, Federico would hold up, or hurry back to put him right. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Ezio. I just want us to get to the medico as soon as we can.&#x201d;</p><p>And indeed it wasn&#x2019;t far, but Ezio was tiring by the minute. Finally they reached the shadowy room, festooned with mysterious instruments and phials of brass and glass, ranged along dark oak tables and hanging from the ceiling along with clusters of dried herbs, where their family doctor had his surgery. It was all Ezio could do to remain on his feet.</p><p>Dottore Ceresa was not best pleased at being roused in the middle of the night, but his manner changed to one of concern as soon as he had brought a candle close enough to inspect Ezio&#x2019;s wound in detail. &#x201c;Hmmn,&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made quite a mess of yourself this time, young man. Can&#x2019;t you people think of anything better to do than go around beating each other up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a question of honour, good doctor,&#x201d; put in Federico.</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; said the doctor, evenly.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really nothing,&#x201d; said Ezio, though he felt faint.</p><p>Federico, as usual hiding concern behind humour, said, &#x201c;Do patch him up as best you can, friend. That pretty little face of his is his only asset.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, fottiti!&#x201d; Ezio hit back, giving his brother the finger.</p><p>The doctor ignored them, washed his hands, probed the wound gently, and poured some clear fluid from one of his many bottles on to a piece of linen. He dabbed the wound with this and it stung so much that Ezio almost sprang from his chair, his face screwed up with the pain. Then, satisfied that the wound was clean, the doctor took a needle and threaded it with fine catgut.</p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This really will hurt, a little.&#x201d;</p><p>Once the stitches were in and the wound bandaged so that Ezio looked like a turbaned Turk, the doctor smiled encouragement. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be three fiorini, for now. I&#x2019;ll come to your palazzo in a few days and remove the stitches. That&#x2019;ll be another three fiorini to pay then. You&#x2019;ll have a terrible headache, but it&#x2019;ll pass. Just try to rest&#x2014;if it&#x2019;s in your nature! And don&#x2019;t worry: the wound looks worse than it is, and there&#x2019;s even a bonus: there shouldn&#x2019;t be much of a scar, so you won&#x2019;t be disappointing the ladies too greatly in future!&#x201d;</p><p>Once they were back in the street, Federico put his arm round his younger brother. He pulled out a fl ask and offered it to Ezio. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said, noticing the expression on Ezio&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s our father&#x2019;s best grappa. Better than mother&#x2019;s milk for a man in your condition.&#x201d;</p><p>They both drank, feeling the fiery liquid warm them. &#x201c;Quite a night,&#x201d; said Federico.</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed. I only wish they were all as much fun as&#x2014;&#x201d; But Ezio interrupted himself as he saw that his brother was beginning to grin from ear to ear. &#x201c;Oh, wait!&#x201d; he corrected himself, laughing: &#x201c;They are!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even so, I think a little food and drink wouldn&#x2019;t be a bad thing to set you up before we go home,&#x201d; said Federico. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s late, I know, but there&#x2019;s a taverna nearby where they don&#x2019;t close until breakfast time and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You and the oste are amici intimi?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you guess?&#x201d;</p><p>An hour or so later, after a meal of ribollita and bistecca washed down with a bottle of Brunello, Ezio felt as if he&#x2019;d never been wounded at all. He was young and fit, and felt that all his lost energy had flowed back into him. The adrenaline of the victory over the Pazzi mob certainly contributed to the swiftness of his recovery.</p><p>&#x201c;Time to go home, little brother,&#x201d; said Federico. &#x201c;Father&#x2019;s sure to be wondering where we are, and you&#x2019;re the one he looks to to help him with the bank.

It covers the diverse natural community thrives in the milkweed growing along our highways and woodland edges; in our open fields, fragmented prairies and vacant lots; and in our lovingly tended gardens. Several kinds of insects depend on milkweed as a food source. The best known of these are the monarch butterflies whose late summer generation graduates from milkweed nurseries all over North America to join in an impressive migration. Some fly as far as 4800 kilometers (3000 miles) from the northern United States and Canada to the mountains of Michoacan, Mexico. That incredible accomplishment by such a small, seemingly delicate creature has captured our imaginations and awakened many of us to the milkweed community. We invite you to explore the milkweed growing in your neighborhood for a fascinating glimpse into the complex interdependence of life on our planet. In the six years since the publication of the first edition, Milkweed, Monarchs and More has found its way into classrooms, homes, and nature centers. The larger type and pictures in Milkweed, Monarchs and More, The Enlarged and Updated Second Edition are in response to requests for a larger format-����more classroom friendly for student reports and easier on older eyes. We&#39;ve also updated many of the sections, and added more information on milkweed. We hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Ba Rea has researched, drawn, photographed and written about many different plants, animals and natural phenomena.

Through the prisms of archeology, theology, anthropology, and evolutionary psychology, Wright repeatedly overturns conventional wisdom to show how and why religion can strengthen the social order-even in an age of globalization-and explains why modern science is not only compatible with religion, but actively affirms the validity of the religious quest. <br><br> Vast in scope and thrilling in ambition, <i>The Evolution of God</i> brilliantly alters our understanding of God and where He came from-and where He and we are going next.</p><p>Robert Wright is a contributing editor of <em>The New Republic</em>, a Slate.com columnist, and a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the cofounder of www.bloggingheads.tv, runs the web-based video project www.meaningoflife.tv, and lives in Princeton, NJ, with his wife and two daughters.Using evolutionary psychology, Robert Wright explores how the morality of societies changed as those societies became more complex and how monotheism is an outgrowth of personal morality. The material is deep and detailed, so it is essential that the narrator keep the book from becoming mind-numbing in audio form. Arthur Morey does a solid job. For instance, he breaks up long sentences into logical chunks, with appropriate pauses. He also varies his tone slightly to give emphasis to unusual or especially important points. His pronunciation is impressive, especially when he vocalizes sounds from African languages for which there sometimes are no English equivalents. But the book requires concentration on the part of the listener, especially in the early part, where the author describes early societies and their belief systems in intense detail.

Her name is Lupe, and she thinks she sees what&#x2019;s coming&#x2014;specifically, her own future and her brother&#x2019;s. Lupe is a mind reader; she doesn&#x2019;t know what everyone is thinking, but she knows what most people are thinking. Regarding what <i>has</i> happened, as opposed to what <i>will,</i> Lupe is usually right about the past; without your telling her, she knows all the worst things that have happened to you.<br> <br>Lupe doesn&#x2019;t know the future as accurately. But consider what a terrible burden it is, if you believe you know the future&#x2014;especially your own future, or, even worse, the future of someone you love. What might a thirteen-year-old girl be driven to do, if she thought she could change the future?<br> <br>As an older man, Juan Diego will take a trip to the Philippines, but what travels with him are his dreams and memories; he is most alive in his childhood and early adolescence in Mexico. As we grow older&#x2014;most of all, in what we remember and what we dream&#x2014;we live in the past. Sometimes, we live more vividly in the past than in the present.<br> <br><i>Avenue of Mysteries </i>is the story of what happens to Juan Diego in the Philippines, where what happened to him in the past&#x2014;in Mexico&#x2014;collides with his future.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2015:</strong> Juan Diego got his start in a Oaxacan dump, where he and his sister were self-described &#x201c;dump kids.&#x201d; Their mother Esperanza was a prostitute/cleaning woman, and in <em>Avenue of Mysteries</em> we revisit Esperanza, a pair of Jesuits who affected Juan Diego&#x2019;s life, various circus members, Juan Diego, his sister, and others in a series of flashbacks. Having salvaged books in English and Spanish from the dump, Juan Diego taught himself to read and, ultimately, to write&#x2014;he becomes a successful author, who eventually winds up in Iowa. Now in his fifties, he takes a trip to the Philippines, where he encounters a mother and her daughter, both of them fans, who insist on taking him around. If you&#x2019;re a John Irving fan, some of the details to the story will sound familiar. It&#x2019;s also likely you won&#x2019;t have a problem with that. What I found most satisfying about Irving&#x2019;s latest novel was a return of the feelings I remember from back when I first discovered his writing. This is an immersive read that delivers character, humor, and emotion. <em> &#x2013; Chris Schluep</em></p>John Irving was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1942.

The boy has been found hanged, a presumed suicide, in Venice&#39;s elite military academy. Brunetti&#39;s sorrow for the boy, so close in age to his own son, is rivaled only by his contempt for a community that is more concerned with protecting the reputation of the school, and its privileged students, than understanding this tragedy. The young man is the son of a doctor and former politician, a man of an impeccable integrity all too rare in Italian politics. Dr. Moro is clearly and understandably devastated by his son&#39;s death; but while both he and his apparently estranged wife seem convinced that the boy&#39;s death could not have been suicide, neither appears eager to talk to the police or involve Brunetti in any investigation of the circumstances in which he died. As Brunetti pursues his inquiry, he is faced with a wall of silence. Is the military protecting its own? And what of the other witnesses? Is this the natural reluctance of Italians to involve themselves with the authorities, or is Brunetti facing a conspiracy far greater than this one death?</p><p><b>Donna Leon</b> is the author of the international best-selling Commissario Guido Brunetti series. The winner of the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, among other awards, Leon was born in New Jersey and has lived in Venice for thirty years.<p>Brunetti arrived before the children did, so he opted to keep Paola company while she finished preparing the meal. As she set the table, he lifted pot lids and opened the oven, comforted to find nothing but familiar dishes: lentil soup, chicken smothered in red cabbage, and what looked like radicchio di Treviso.</p> <p>"Are you bringing all of your detective skills to bear in examining that chicken?" Paola asked as she set glasses on the table.</p> <p>"No, not really," he said, closing the oven and standing upright. "My investigation has to do with the radicchio, Signora, and whether there are perhaps traces in it of the same pancetta I detected in the lentil soup."</p> <p>"A nose as good as that," she said, coming over and placing the tip of her finger on it, "could effectively put an end to crime in this city." "I went to see Signora Moro," he began, pausing to see if Paola would react. She did not, so he went on, "I wanted to talk to her about the hunting accident."</p> <p>"And?" Paola prodded.</p> <p>"Someone shot at her from the woods near her friends' house, but then some other hunters came along and took her to the hospital."</p> <p>"Are you sure they were other hunters?" Paola asked, giving evidence that her native skepticism had been enhanced by more than two decades of marriage to a policeman.</p> <p>"It would seem so," he said, leaving it at that.</p> <p>Knowing how reluctant he would be to mention him, Paola asked, "And the boy?"</p> <p>"She said that he didn't kill himself, and that's all she said."</p> <p>"She's his mother," Paola said.

Similar in format to <i>Zoo in the Sky: A Book of Animal Constellations </i> (1998), this companion volume presents a series of 10 constellations and briefly retells the Greek myths related to them. Each of the main double-page spreads introduces a figure, such as Cassiopeia, Lyra, or Hercules, using a few short paragraphs of text and three-quarter page illustrations in glowing colors. Some of the tales relate to one another in a sequence, while others are told separately. Although the stories are quite short, Mitton's vivid word choices make the text as dynamic as Balit's striking pictures. Partly abstract and partly representational, the artwork features bold figures of mythological characters with silver-foil stars highlighting the points of light that make up the constellations. The final pages offer information about the stars, nebulae, galaxies, and constellations and give astronomical descriptions of the constellations featured. On the endpapers, star maps of the northern and southern skies show the featured constellations in red on black.

And then it happens. Dave lands in an orphanage&#x2014;the cold and strict Hebrew Home for Boys in Harlem&#x2014;far from the life he knew on the Lower East Side. But he's not so worried. He knows he'll be okay. He always is. If it doesn't work out, he'll just leave, find a better place to stay. But it's not that simple.</p><p>Outside the gates of the orphanage, the nighttime streets of Harlem buzz with jazz musicians and swindlers; exclusive parties and mystifying strangers. Inside, another world unfolds, thick with rare friendships and bitter enemies. Perhaps somewhere, among it all, Dave can find a place that feels like home.</p></p><p>"Gideon the Genius" and "Dave the Daredevil," their father called them: two Jewish boys growing up in 1920s New York, playing stickball and--in Dave's case--getting into trouble. But when their father dies, Dave finds himself separated from his older brother and thrust into the cold halls of the HHB, the Hebrew Home for Boys (which he later dubs the "Hopeless House of Beggars" and the "Hell Hole for Brats," among other things).<p> Eager to escape the strict rules, constant bullying, and tasteless gruel of the orphanage, the Daredevil hops the wall one night to explore the streets of Harlem. He hears what he thinks is someone--or something?--laughing, but traces the sound to a late-night trumpeter shuffling backward into a wild "rent party." And just as quickly as he'd found himself stuck in the HHB, Dave is immersed in yet another world--the swinging salons and speakeasies of the Harlem Renaissance. Cramped, crazy parties packed with the likes of Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen give Dave refuge from life at the orphanage and awaken his artistic bent. And Dave's new friends, among them a grandfatherly "gonif" ("somebody who fools people out of their money") and a young "colored" heiress who takes a shine to him, help turn things around for him at the HHB.</p><p> The skilled Gail Carson Levine, Newbery Medal-winning author of <i>Ella Enchanted</i>, clearly tells this tale from her heart, as the story is based on her own father's childhood spent in the real-life HOA (Hebrew Orphan Asylum). (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>urs<br>4 cassettes<br><br>It was the last place anyone should have called Home, the last place for kids to live --<br><br>The year is 1926. Dave's beloved father is dead and his stepmother doesn't want him. Only the HHB will take him in--Hebrew Home for Boys -- Hell Hold for Brats. But Dave is tough and a troublemaker. He can take care of himself. If he doesn't like the Home, he'll run away and find a better place. Only it's not that simple... <br><br></p><h2>1960s Austin Gangsters: Organized Crime that Rocked the Capital (True Crime)</h2><p>Timmy Overton of Austin and Jerry Ray James of Odessa were football stars who traded athletics for lives of crime.

This book contains a collection of beginning drawing lessons and text for practicing handwriting based on the philosophy of author Marie Hablitzel. An elementary teacher for more than 30 years, Marie believed that drawing and handwriting require many of the same skills, and intertwined her daily drawing and handwriting lessons with math, science, social studies, geography, reading and creative writing. This series separates these lessons into common themes in eight instructive books that can be used in any order. Books are colorful and non-consumable, with an accompanying workbook to record the student s work. Children will improve their drawing skills, refine their handwriting clarity, and enjoy learning in the process!</p><p>Learn about North America&#x2019;s diverse native cultures, past and present, then explore the vast continent. Each colorful lesson combines beginning drawing instruction with writing. Teachers may introduce letter formation, have children practice handwriting, or use the lessons as a springboard for creative writing activities. The series won the Teachers' Choice Award and is a regular recipient of Practical Homeschooling Reader Awards.My students entered the classroom each morning and saw a chart propped in the front of the room -- a hand-drawn 24" x 18" picture with four sentences - which related to our science, history, social studies, or geography curriculum. The day began with questions like, "What is that . . . what are we drawing today?" <p> I kept the subject in my drawings simple, presented the material as part of a unit study, and found that my students' background drawings and their discussion reflected an understanding of the material. </p><p> I included three to four short sentences, with easy spelling and vocabulary, for handwriting practice. Many of my students needed to learn the basics of letter formation and sentence structure, and for some, English was a new language. I copied the four sentences onto the chalkboard, describing and modeling each letter, punctuation, or space. The children who were already competent writers worked at their own pace and focused on neatly copying the sentences. The consistent practice improved writing speed and legibility, while giving everyone the confidence to write. It made a huge difference in the other assignments I gave throughout the day. </p><p>I found that starting the day with a drawing lesson and handwriting practice gave everyone a feeling of success and a good start to the day. Since publishing the books, we have heard many ways teachers modify the lessons to fit their own needs and teaching styles. Some use the lessons for creative writing, report writing or grammar instruction. Others use the books in centers or as a resource during independent time. It is gratifying to realize that the lessons I created in response to my students' needs in the 40s and 50s have proved to be a flexible, valuable tool for teachers today. -- Marie Hablitzel</p></p><h2>Encyclopedia of Classic &amp; Vintage Stitches: 245 Illustrated Embroidery Stitches for Cross Stitch, Crewel, Beadwork, Needlelace, Stumpwork, and More (IMM Lifestyle Books)</h2><p><p>It's the ultimate sourcebook for stitchwork practitioners!

Once I do, when should I take Social Security? Do I need to buy an annuity to make sure I have enough money to last my whole life? Should I move everything into &#x201c;safe&#x201d; investments? In short, what do I need to do now to ensure a comfortable retirement? <em>Control Your Retirement Destiny: Achieving Financial Security Before the Big Transition</em> provides practical how-to knowledge on what you need to do to get your finances in order to prepare for a transition out of the workforce. While never easy, retirement investing from your 20s through your early 50s has been straightforward. But once you hit your mid 50s and beyond, you need a different kind of plan to align investments, retirement accounts, taxes, Social Security, and pension decisions, all with a single objective: providing reliable, life-long income. In this book, nationally known retirement expert Dana Anspach explains how each part works, how one decision affects another, and how to focus on the things you can control (like managing taxes and risk) rather than on those you can&#x2019;t control (such as inflation or investment returns). When you put it all together in a plan that works for you, you&#x2019;ll have more choices and a greater sense of security about the financial decisions you are making. A transition into retirement can be scary. <em>Control Your Retirement Destiny</em> equips you with the knowledge you&#x2019;ll need to avoid big mistakes while optimizing the flow of funds to support the retirement you&#x2019;ve always dreamed of. This book: - Covers all the major topics in retirement planning &#x2013; investments, Social Security, annuities, taxes, healthcare, part-time work, and more - Provides examples of how planning decisions can result in a more secure outcome when they are coordinated - Helps couples coordinate their retirement incomes to maximize benefits - Shows how to create a plan to enable the life you&#x2019;d like to live after ending full-time employment - Explains how to work with advisors (and how to find the best ones) if you&#x2019;d rather not plan your own finances <em>Control Your Retirement Destiny: Achieving Financial Security Before the Big Transition</em> is for those who are beginning to think about when and how they might transition out of regular, full-time work. It will enable you to take charge of your financial future right now to ensure a happy, secure retirement.</p><p>In 2008, Dana Anspach began writing for About.com as their MoneyOver55 Expert.

This is one of the most important books of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Walter Isaacson, author of <em>Steve Jobs</em> and professor of history, Tulane</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Ronan Farrow has scooped us all (again). And it is no wonder. A gifted writer with a powerful intellect and a passion for truth, Farrow has become one of this generation&#x2019;s finest journalists and <em>War on Peace</em> a book that will be required reading for generations to come.&nbsp;It is perhaps the most riveting and relatable book on foreign policy and diplomacy I have ever read.

He teams up with Megan, a sassy college grad whose indomitable spirit eclipses her lack of experience, and Lemmy, a cartoonist from overseas whose off-kilter commentary on the wonders and frustrations of the trail keeps everyone laughing.<br>Sprawling through the woods and towns of the Appalachian mountains, the trail carries the trio through real and fanciful ups and downs ranging from hilarious to perilous. Much more than an orderly account of mountain tops and meals, it is an adventure about friends figuring things out as they go.

(.5-.6 kg) </p><p><b>Male:</b> A non-eared owl. Rusty tan on the back of head, back, wings and tail. Heart-shaped white facial disk, outlined in darker rusty brown. White breast and belly with many scattered tiny dark marks. Dark eyes. Long gray legs and gray feet. Ivory bill. White wing linings. </p><p><b>Female:</b> slightly larger than male, with a rusty wash over a spotted breast and belly </p><p><b>Juvenile:</b> fuzzy-looking with light gray-to-white plumage and a distinct heart-shaped face </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> farm fields, woods, cliffs, semi-wooded areas, suburban areas, prairies </p><p><b>Food:</b> mice and other small animals, birds, snakes </p><p><b>Sounds:</b> harsh hissing any time of year; female call is more quiet than the male; juvenile call is hoarser </p><p><b>Compare:</b> Easily identified by the white heart-shaped facial disk and dark eyes. The Snowy Owl (pg. 233) is much larger, has white plumage and lacks a heart-shaped face. Slightly larger than Short-eared Owl (pg. 213), which has a streaked chest and belly, dark marks around each eye and a less defined facial disk. </p><p><b>Flight:</b> long broad wings, rounded at the tip and cupped or bowed downward during flight; slow, shallow wing beats with silent flight </p><p><b>Migration:</b> non-migrator to partial; will congregate in groups during winter </p><p><b>Nesting:</b> cavity, in a man-made structure such as a barn, other outbuilding or wooden nest box, occasionally in a tree cavity, cliff crevice or small cave; 1 brood </p><p><b>Eggs/Incubation:</b> 3-7 white eggs; female incubates 30-34 days; male does the most hunting and feeds the nesting female before and after the young hatch </p><p><b>Fledging:</b> 52-56 days; male and female feed young; male does the majority of hunting and brings food to the female, who feeds the chicks; upon leaving the nest (fledging), the young continue to beg for food, at first waiting for the parents to bring food, then following them around to be fed; chicks learn to hunt by watching and copying their parents&#x2019; behavior, staying with them until the adults prepare for nesting again </p><p><b>Stan&#x2019;s Notes:</b> Well known for nesting in old barns, but also nests in any dark cavity in trees or on cliffs. Readily takes to wooden nest boxes erected by people. Hunts by coursing over open areas after dark, looking and listening for small animals. Employs eyesight mainly, but can hunt in total darkness using its hearing alone. Will sway back and forth with head lowered when confronted. </p><p>A good friend to farmers. One study showed that over the average 10-year life span of a typical Barn Owl, a single owl will consume approximately 11,000 mice. Based on the amount of food a mouse eats in a day, each year Barn Owls prevent roughly 13 tons of grain and crops from being eaten by mice. </p><p>Monogamous and believed to mate for life, with pairs using the same nesting cavity for many years, sometimes for a century or more. Clutch size is dependent on the availability of prey&#x2013;the more prey, the larger the clutch. The young hatch one per day (asynchronously) over two weeks, creating a range of ages within the nest. Families reside at the same nesting site for generations.</p></p><h2>Tarot of Pagan Cats</h2><p><p>Journey with the enlightened feline and welcome their unique secrets. Cats&#x2015;cute, mysterious, mischievous, or aloof&#x2015;seem to live in a world between worlds, a realm of magic and power. Access their unique wisdom with this beautifully illustrated deck, featuring traditional Rider-Waite imagery and Pagan symbols.</p><p>The companion booklets for most Lo Scarabeo decks are in five languages: English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.</p></p><p><p>Lo Scarabeo's Tarot decks have been acclaimed all over the world for originality and quality. With the best Italian and international artists, each Lo Scarabeo deck is an exceptional artistic value.</p> <p>Commited to developing innovative new decks while preserving the rich tradition of Tarot, Lo Scarabeo continues to be a favorite among collectors and readers.</p> <p>Llewellyn is the exclusive distributor of Lo Scarabeo products in North America.</p><p> </p> <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>Tarot of the Pagan Cats</em>&nbsp;is a true RWS-style that cleverly interweaves magick and Tarot as experienced through the eyes of cats. Natural and easy to read, this deck will delight the beginner as well as the more experienced reader.</p> <p><strong>In-Depth Review</strong></p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>Tarot of&nbsp;Pagan Cats</em>&nbsp;was created with three goals in mind:</p> <ol> <li>To be a RWS-style deck<br></li> <li>To explore the Tarot via realistic cats, and<br></li> <li>To weave the elements and magick into the images<br></li> </ol> <p>The deck does all of these quite nicely.</p> <p>The cats adorning these cards are drawn to look natural. And except for the odd crown, garland, or charm hanging from a collar, these cats do look much as they would in real life. Lola Airaghi did an excellent job of capturing subtle expressions on these fascinating felines. The knights, however, are an exception. Each knight is riding (as is the habit of knights) another creature. The Knight of Wands rides a fox; the Knight of Cups, a turtle; the Knight of Swords, an owl; and the Knight of Pentacles, a goat.</p> <p>The deck does intend to be more than just cats playing at Tarot. These are, after all, supposed to be Pagan cats. The Paganism shows up mostly in terms of the cats&#x2019; relationship to and use of the elements, which, although very magickal, is also quite familiar and comfortable for most Tarot readers whether pagan or not.</p> <p>Magick does inform the deck images. It begins with the Fool dreaming of or imagining an intent. Magical practitioners know that intent is vital to any sort of magical activity. The Major Arcana sequence ends with the World, showing that the dream of the Fool has been manifested.</p> <p>Another interesting pair is the 4 and 10 of Swords. In the 4 a spell is being worked. The altar is attended to, the cat is peaceful in the knowledge that what can be done has beeen done. In the 10 (the only card without a cat in the image), there are ten swords in place of the cat. Cobwebs cover the altar. The magick is gone, only a trace is in the air flowing out the window. Has the magick been completed or has it been abandoned?</p> <p>The court cards are particularly well designed. The Pages relate to the Aces. In the Pages, the cat is the focus, while in the Aces, the suit designator is the focus, clearly illustrating the subtle difference and important similarity between these two sets of cards. The Queens relate to the Empress, showing the cats sitting on pillows, symbolizing a nurturing, comforting power. The Kings relate to the Emperor. The Emperor is shown on a pedestal made of four steps. Each step is engraved with the symbols of one of the suits. The Kings are shown on a cube engraved with an animal representing their suit. The Knights relate to the Chariot.</p> <p>There are plenty of interesting, interwoven delights to discover in this deck. It is one of those rare decks that are as easy to read with as they are fascinating to study.</p> <p><strong>Attributes</strong></p> <p><strong>Name of deck</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Tarot of Pagan Cats</em></p> <p><strong>Publisher</strong>: Lo Scarabeo</p> <p><strong>EAN</strong>:&nbsp;9780738726700</p> <p><strong>Creator's name</strong>: Magdelina Messina</p> <p><strong>Artist's name</strong>: Lola Airaghi</p> <p><strong>Brief biography of artist:</strong>&nbsp;Lola Airaghi studied at the Scuola del Fumetto di Milano.

The author lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><p></p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2013;This third book featuring the young and modernized Amelia is more of a traditional picture book than an easy reader, and the oversize format allows for plenty of space for the many activities that take place. Pictures in fall colors are in various sizes, from full page to several smaller illustrations per page, featuring apples, pumpkins, and autumn-hued leaves. Here, Amelia is visiting her grandparents and making a pie with Grandma. She's still up to her typical antics, mistaking Granny Smith for a person and thinking that a farmer's market is a place to buy farmers. Children will find the humor relevant and funny. The illustrations flow well with the text; the words are placed in a manner that creates movement, guiding the eye from picture to picture. This is a great book to use for a fall unit or storyhour. The apple pie recipe is included at the end.&#x2013;Lora Van Marel, Orland Park Public Library, IL. (c) Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

No one you&#x2019;ve ever met, either. None of us are normal according to God&#x2019;s definition, and the closer we get to each other, the plainer that becomes. Yet for all our quirks, sins, and jagged edges, we need each other. Community is more than just a word&#x2015;it is one of our most fundamental requirements. So how do flawed, abnormal people such as ourselves master the forces that can drive us apart and come together in the life-changing relationships God designed us for?</p><p>In <em>Everybody&#x2019;s Normal Till You Get to Know Them</em>, teacher and bestselling author John Ortberg zooms in on the things that make community tick. You&#x2019;ll get a thought-provoking look at God&#x2019;s heart, at others, and at yourself. Even better, you&#x2019;ll gain wisdom and tools for drawing closer to others in powerful, impactful ways. With humor, insight, and a gift for storytelling, Ortberg shows how community pays tremendous dividends in happiness, health, support, and growth. It&#x2019;s where all of us weird, unwieldy people encounter God&#x2019;s love in tangible ways and discover the transforming power of being loved, accepted, and valued just the way we are.</p></p><p><p>John Ortberg is the senior pastor of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church (MPPC) in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In this mediocre treatise on Christian community, Ortberg implicates Christians who are constantly on the run and on the most superficial terms with their fellows. Citing numerous biblical stories where Jesus turned the tables on foes and drew in unlovable and undesirable people, Ortberg nicely communicates his passion for seeing past external appearances and delving deeply into people's hearts and souls. Christians, he says, must learn to communicate on Jesus' terms; they should practice unconditional love, strive for authenticity and build mutual trust. While Ortberg warns readers to be circumspect with personal disclosure, he contends that the modern Christian church has failed miserably in biblical communication, especially in loving confrontation. Still, the overall message of this book is upbeat, as Ortberg reminds readers of the positive aspects found in solid relationships, which he names as genuine forgiveness, deliberate inclusion and heartfelt gratitude. While this message is ageless, it is certainly not new; "Christian living" bookshelves are crowded with volumes on spiritual formation, congregational life, group prayer and communication. Among these, Ortberg's offering loses its impact quickly because of poor organization, various tangents and over-long chapters. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Complete Textbook of Holistic Self Diagnosis</h2><p>A simple to use diagnosis methods for non-professionals, professionals, and children.

Men like Henry Brown and Burt Alvord worked on both sides of the law either at different times of their lives or simultaneously. Clever shyster Soapy Smith and murderer Martin Couk survived by their wits, while the outlaw careers of the dimwitted DeAutremont brothers and bigmouthed Diamondfield Jack were severely limited by their intellect, or lack thereof. Nearly everyone in these pages was motivated by greed, revenge, or a lethal mixture of the two.

From the years of success as an Oxford scholar, to entry into the newly founded Society of Jesus and a professorship in Prague, Campion&#39;s life was an inexorable progress towards the doomed mission to England. There followed pursuit, betrayal, a spirited defense of loyalty to the Queen, and a horrifying martyr&#39;s death at Tyburn.</p><p></p><h2>The Three Books of Enoch and the Book of Giants</h2><p><p>This book includes 1 Enoch: The Ethiopic Book of Enoch; 2 Enoch: The Slavonic Book of the Secrets of Enoch; 3 Enoch: The Hebrew Book of Enoch; and versions of the Book of Giants.</p><p>The 1st Book of Enoch, the Ethiopic Book of Enoch, or 1 Enoch is more known as simply the Book of Enoch. Although this book is considered apocryphal for the Western canon, it is contained in the Ethiopic Bible. It was considered sacred by some important first followers of Christ but it was left out of the Bible and disappeared for centuries until it was rediscovered in 1773 in Ethiopic. This manuscript was first translated into English in the 1820s and into German in the 1830s. According to most scholars, part of it was written in third century BCE and part of it in the first century CE (the part related to the Son of Man). Although the oldest complete copies of 1 Enoch are K-9 or Kebran 9, dated late fourteenth early fifteenth century and Ethiopian Monastic Microfilm Library (EMML 2080) of the fifteenth or fourteenth century, fragments found in Qumram in the 1950s are more than 2000 years old. Other old important manuscripts are Abbadianus 55 (possibly fifteenth century) and British Museum Orient 485 (first half of the sixteenth century).</p><p>The 2nd Book of Enoch, the Slavonic Enoch, or 2 Enoch, is another apocryphal book, found complete only in Old Slavonic manuscripts, and it was once present in the Old Slavonic Bible. It's usually dated to the first century CE although Matthew Black in The Oxford Guide to People &amp; Places of the Bible state that there is no manuscript "earlier than the fourteenth century BE."</p><p>The 3rd Book of Enoch, the Hebrew Enoch, or 3 Enoch, is a Rabbinic text originally written in Hebrew usually dated to the fifth century CE. Some experts believe it was written by Rabbi Ishmael (second century CE), familiar with both 1 Enoch and 2 Enoch.</p><p>The Book of Giants contains a narrative that involves the antediluvian giant offspring originally known from both the Genesis and the Book of Enoch. The Book of Giants resembles particularly 1 Enoch: The First Book of Enoch.</p></p><p></p><h2>Big Al and Shrimpy</h2><p>Poor Shrimpy! He may be the smartest fish in the sea, but he&#39;s also the smallest. Who would want to be friends with such a teeny, tiny fish? Big Al, that&#39;s who! Big Al remembers what it feels like to to be an outsider, and he and Shrimpy become best friends. And when Big Al finds himself in danger, it&#39;s Shrimpy&#39;s smart thinking that saves the day -- and wins Shrimpy the respect and affection of other fish.</p><p>Andrew Clements is the author of the enormously popular <i>Frindle</i>.

One day, Big Al's fin gets stuck in a crack in a rock, and it's clever Shrimpy who comes up with a plan to save him. The story is enhanced by the lovely underwater scenes, which are done in embroidery, paint, and batik on silk. Yoshi pays good attention to detail; when the text indicates that 3 groups of 10 fish help Big Al, readers see 30 fish doing just that. When the author states that Shrimpy could fly through the water faster than ever before, the illustration shows him clinging to one of Big Al's fins as they swim along. Occasionally, the dark text requires good lighting to see clearly as it is on top of darker coloring, and the text is occasionally a bit choppy.

Shellum describes how, during his remarkable army career, Young was shuffled among the few assignments deemed suitable for a black officer in a white man&#x2019;s army&#x2014;the Buffalo Soldier regiments, an African American college, and diplomatic posts in black republics such as Liberia. Nonetheless, he used his experience to establish himself as an exceptional cavalry officer. He was a colonel on the eve of the United States&#x2019; entry into World War I, when serious medical problems and racial intolerance denied him command and ended his career. Shellum&#x2019;s book seeks to restore a hero to the ranks of military history; at the same time, it informs our understanding of the role of race in the history of the American military.</p><p>Brian Shellum is currently a senior intelligence analyst with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization with the U.S. Department of Defense. He worked as a historian at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for the 12 years from 1994 to 2006. Prior to that he served in the U.S. Army as an armor officer and West European foreign area specialist before retiring in 1994. His military career highlights include various troop assignments with tank units, a tour as an army attach� in Bonn, Germany, Gulf War I service on the staff of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, and work as a senior intelligence analyst at DIA.

Centuries of scientific progress have not diminished the irresistible attraction of gazing at picture cards to see the future and determine one's fate. <br>This book by Arthur Edward Waite, the designer of the most widely known Tarot deck and distinguished scholar of the Kabbalah, is the essential Tarot reference. The pictorial key contains a detailed description of each card in the celebrated 78-card Rider-Waite Tarot deck, along with regular and reversed meanings. Contents describe symbols and secret tradition; the four suits of Tarot, including wands, cups, swords, and pentacles; the recurrence of cards in dealing; an ancient Celtic method of divination; as well as wonderful illustrations of Tarot cards.<br>While the perfect complement to old-style fortune telling, <i>The Pictorial Key to the Tarot </i>also serves to make the Tarot entirely accessible to modern-day readers. It is also the classic guide to the Rider-Waite deck and to Tarot symbolism in general.</p><p>Arthur Edward Waite (October 2, 1857 - May 19, 1942) was a scholarly mystic who wrote extensively on occult and esoteric matters, and was the co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck. As his biographer, R.A. Gilbert described him, &#34;Waite&#39;s name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of western occultism - viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of proto-science or as the pathology of religion.&#34;</p><h2>The Case for the Psalms: Why They Are Essential</h2><p>The Case for the Psalms by N.

In <em>The Case for the Psalms</em>, Wright calls us to return to the Psalms as a steady, vital component of healthy Christian living. </p><p>Reading, studying, and praying the Psalms is God's means for teaching us what it means to be human: how to express our emotions and yearnings, how to reconcile our anger and our compassion, how to see our story in light of God's sweeping narrative of salvation. Wright provides the tools for understanding and incorporating these crucial verses into our own lives. His conclusion is simple: all Christians need to read, pray, sing, and live the Psalms.</p><p>N.

With remarkable insight, Kelly dispels dozens of myths that surround the rejection of Catholicism today and provides a profound and practical vision of what will lead the Catholic Church to thrive again in the future. <i>Rediscover Catholicism</i> is quickly becoming the most read catholic book of our times.

Over the past fifteen years Kelly has visited several hundred high schools, inspiring students to use their lives to make a contribution. The foundation's most recent initiative is a grade-school program entitled, Why am I Here? Matthew is also one of the most passionate Catholic speakers and authors of our time. Raised Catholic, Kelly discovered what he calls the genius of Catholicism in his teens and has spent the past two decades inspiring millions of men, woman, and children to explore the faith in a fresh way.

Hamilton and others. The book provoked widespread and heated debate. Written in part as a response, The Extended Phenotype gave a deeper clarification of the central concept of the gene as the unit of selection; but it did much more besides. In it, Dawkins extended the gene&#39;s eye view to argue that the genes that sit within an organism have an influence that reaches out beyond the visible traits in that body - the phenotype - to the wider environment, which can include other individuals. So, for instance, the genes of the beaver drive it to gather twigs to produce the substantial physical structure of a dam; and the genes of the cuckoo chick produce effects that manipulate the behaviour of the host bird, making it nurture the intruder as one of its own. This notion of the extended phenotype has proved to be highly influential in the way we understand evolution and the natural world. It represents a key scientific contribution to evolutionary biology, and it continues to play an important role in research in the life sciences. The Extended Phenotype is a conceptually deep book that forms important reading for biologists and students. But Dawkins&#39; clear exposition is accessible to all who are prepared to put in a little effort. Oxford Landmark Science books are &#39;must-read&#39; classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.</p><p>Professor Richard Dawkins is one of the most influential science writers and communicators of our generation. He was the first holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he held from 1995 until 2008, and is Emeritus Fellow of New College,<br>Oxford. His bestselling books include The Selfish Gene (1976), The Extended Phenotype (1982) and its sequel The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2004), The Ancestor's Tale (2004), and The God<br>Delusion (2007). He has won many literary and scientific awards, including the 1987 Royal Society of Literature Award, the 1990 Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the 1994 Nakayama Prize for Human Science, the 1997 International Cosmos Prize, and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the<br>Public Interest in 2009."The Extended Phenotype is a sequel to The Selfish Gene ... he writes so clearly it could be understood by anyone prepared to make the effort"<br><br>--John Maynard Smith, LRB<br><br>"This entertaining and thought-provoking book is an excellent illustration of why the study of evolution is in such an exciting ferment these days."<br><br>--Science</p><h2>CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional All-in-One Exam Guide, Second Edition</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Comprehensive coverage of every domain on the CCSP exam</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>This highly effective self-study guide covers all six domains of the 2019 release of the challenging Certified Cloud Security Professional exam as well as the CCSP Common Body of Knowledge, developed by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2�. <i>CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional All-in-One Exam Guide, Second Edition</i> offers clear explanations, real-world examples, and practice questions that match the content, tone, and format of those on the actual exam.

Don&#39;t forget this handy lingo guide If you&#39;re planning a trip to the United Kingdom any time soon, take along a copy of The UK to USA Dictionary - British English vs. American English. This handy, pocket-size guide can help you to avoid embarrassment, as well as solve some of the mysteries which illustrate how Yanks and Brits are separated by a common language. The book includes terms and expressions that differ in British English such as boot for trunk, bonnet for hood, lift for elevator, petrol for gas, trolley for cart, return for round trip and loo for bathroom. Beyond that, it can make entertaining reading on the flight over the North Atlantic. Although the meanings of some of the words in this dictionary may be obvious, others can cause confusion or misunderstanding. For example an acid drop does not refer to illegal drug activities. Acid drop in the UK is a hard candy with a bitter taste. Likewise, an ankle-biter is not an ugly female or male - it&#39;s what known as a rug rat in the U.S. A banger is a sausage and bangers and mash are sausages and mashed potatoes. Some slang words are included but their listing does not condone the use of any derogatory or negative expression. It&#39;s important to note that spellings will differ such as the British vs. American spellings for centre/center, theatre/theater, civilsed/civilized or realise/realize.
